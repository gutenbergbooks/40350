<h2><a href="#contents">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>To the cynic, two nations clasped in murderous embrace
yet nominally living in peace with each other might well be one
of the miracles of our century. No less miraculous has been
for many the tenacity of Chinese resistance to Japan's invasion
ever since the first bullets whizzed through the night near
the Marco Polo Bridge southwest of Peking early in July, 1937.
The undeclared war has spread disaster through an area larger
than that immediately affected in Europe's battles from 1914
to 1918; hundreds of thousands have died in action; for months
China's capital has been in the hands of the enemy. But China
is not on her knees.</p>

<p>The explanation is simple. For the first time in her history,
China fights as a nation. More is involved than can be attributed
to Generalissimo Chiang K'ai-shek's personal leadership
or the strategic and organizational services rendered, until his
recent recall to Germany, by Alexander von Falkenhausen, chief
of staff of the Turkish armies during the World War. A people
without allegiance to its government and without faith in itself
would have been incapable of braving the ordeal of retreat,
massacre, and occupation as successfully as have the Chinese.
That China fights today as a nation is no small tribute to the
National Government of the Kuomintang established at Nanking
in 1927. How long she will be able to fight as a nation is
a question to be answered only by reference to the national
mentality and political institutions which have emerged since
the collapse of the Manchu Empire in 1911-1912. It is the
purpose of this volume to appraise the record of China's republican
era.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_viii" title="pg viii"> </a></p>

<p>The author was compelled to beat his own path. Only a few
books on modern government in China are available in English,
and these, written by Chinese, are modeled in their presentation
on Western prototypes to an extent of obscuring, though unintentionally,
the very substance of Chinese politics. In Dr.
Linebarger's pioneer venture the dynamics of internal instability,
typical of the earlier phases of the Republic, and the gradual
consolidation under the Nanking regime are analyzed with
extraordinary penetration. Instead of being confronted with
meaningless form and empty legality, the reader is placed in a
position to view step by step the evolution of conflicting and merging
forces: political movements and their contest for the loyalty
of the masses, the rough and ready rule of military might, and
the official hierarchies representing organized governments.
Throughout this work, as in Dr. Linebarger's earlier <em>Political
Doctrines of Sun Yat-sen</em>, the broad stream of Confucian thought
fertilizing age after age of China's social existence and Sun's
purposeful ideological adaptations combined in his <em>San Min Chu
I</em> are shown in fundamental harmony. One distinction, however,
stands out clearly. The Confucian tradition applied itself to a
vaguely conceived but essentially unified world order. In the
<em>San Min Chu I</em> we encounter the elements of a national credo,
self-assertive and militant.</p>

<p>The role of ideology in modern government has suffered curious
neglect among students of politics for a considerable time. In
periods of relative ideational saturation or stagnation, the
mechanics of constitutional law or the give and take of legislative
barter may distract from the basic framework of values and
objectives giving shape to the political order. The rise of
totalitarian systems relying heavily on ideological appeal and
propaganda techniques has laid new stress upon those factors
which predetermine political behavior. In China's vast experience
we have the supreme example of ideological guidance so
firmly established as to reduce to a minimum direct governmental
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_ix" title="pg ix"> </a>
intervention in the affairs of the individual. It is perhaps Sun
Yat-sen's tragedy that for years he placed his faith in the magic
of democratic verbiage imported from the West; a new orientation
came to prevail after 1923, when at Sun's instance tested
practitioners of mass organization from the Soviet Union began
to overhaul and streamline the Kuomintang apparatus.</p>

<p>Government in China has become migratory as a result of
Japan's advance. A mere description of its previous structure
and functions would today have little relevance. But Dr.
Linebarger has probed deeply enough into the foundations of
Chinese political life to distinguish with uncommon discernment
between the ephemeral and the durable. His long-range exposition
transcends the exigencies of the hour and delineates the
issues of China's future.</p>

<p>I am deeply indebted to the five gentlemen who have read
the entire manuscript in some one of its stages. My father,
Judge Paul Myron Wentworth Linebarger, has given me tireless
help in this as in all my projects, for which I shall never be able
to tender sufficient thanks. My teacher, Professor Harley
Farnsworth MacNair of the University of Chicago, supplied
numerous addenda and corrigenda of great value from his
knowledge of modern Chinese history. Professor Arthur N.
Holcombe of Harvard University suggested changes which have
made the work more realistic. Assistance offered me by the
Sinologue and philosopher, Professor H. H. Dubs of Duke
University, was of the utmost value. Professor Paul H. Clyde,
Duke University, provided many useful and significant hints,
especially in the field of Sino-foreign relations.</p>

<p>I am also under obligation to Mr. J. C. Yang, Library of
Congress, and Professor James R. Ware, Harvard University, for
further suggestions; to Professor Charles Sidney Gardner and
Dr. John Fairbank, Harvard University, and Professor George
Kennedy, Yale University, for aid in the general course of my
Chinese studies; to Professor Maria Magdalena Schoch, until
recently of the University of Hamburg, Germany, for a critical
reading of the revised manuscript; and to Miss Hazel Foster and
Mr. M. F. Nelson for similar assistance. Mrs. W. M. Gibson,
Miss Whitty Daniel, and my wife have helped in the preparation
of the manuscript.</p>

<h2><a href="#contents">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>The origins of Chinese society may reach half a million years
into the past. Anthropologists have suggested that Sinanthropus
Pekinensis, among the earliest forms of man, resembles the
modern Chinese more closely than he does any other modern race.
In what specific period the earliest ancestors of the Chinese came
to China is not known. It is certain, however, that about 1500
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> there existed a well-developed civilized society in the Yellow
River valley, and that this same society has lived on&mdash;modified
by the centuries, but in unbroken continuity&mdash;down into the
present. China has outlasted Crete, Tyre, Greece, and Rome.
The Aztec empire, which arose in Mexico when China was already
ancient, has become only a memory, while China is still vital.
How is it that China's institutions survive, while those of other
nations did not? How real are Chinese institutions today?
What, precisely, is the Republic of China?</p>

<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Duality or Confluence?</a></em></p>

<p>The phrase <em>Republican China</em> indicates an era rather than a
system. The preceding ages of China have been known by the
names of great dynasties. T'ang China (620-906 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>) overawed
and instructed all eastern Asia. Sung China (<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 960-1279)
flourished, civilian and tolerant, in a world marked by
bigotry and arms. Well into the past century the West remained
distant and vague. Republican China struggles in the presence
of the modern world and subject to its superior force; her very
name is a capitulation to the twentieth century. The problems
of the Republican era are not merely the problems of republican
government; they involve the broad question of the meeting and
interpenetration of civilizations. How are the Chinese, schooled
for thousands of years in the effective operation of their own
political system, to adapt themselves fast enough to the Western
scheme? What happens when they must and yet cannot effectuate
such adaptation? These are not queries to be answered
simply in the routine terms of Western politics.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_2" title="pg 2"> </a></p>

<p>For the past three thousand years and more the eastern end of
the European-Asiatic land mass has formed a world to itself.
Most of this time it was larger, richer, and more civilized than the
European world. Down to the nineteenth century of the Christian
era the Chinese had no reason to suppose that theirs was
not the most advanced and powerful of civilized societies. They
looked upon the Far East as the all-inclusive universe of civilization;
to them, their way of life was the common-sense way. The
Europeans did likewise, with reference to their own sphere.
When the European realm expanded so as to include the whole
planet, when Western civilization began to dominate the earth,
and the Christian family of nations became the world-wide international
system, the Chinese were forced to concede that the Far
East could not be kept to itself. They have found it indispensable
to respond, as individuals and as a people, to the new environment
closing in on them. Doing so has necessitated the reexamination
and restatement of nearly all basic values of Chinese life.</p>

<p>Since the nineteenth century the Chinese have been faced with
the alternative of adhering to their own traditions or accepting
those of the West. Institutions and practices which are so well
established that they seem to rest on sheer common sense in
each of the competing civilizations have been placed in juxtaposition.
As a result, the Chinese now know two kinds of common
sense to justify a course of action. The ensuing difficulty at
times goes deeper; for they may be said to have even two kinds
of sanity. In old China a man who wanted no sons seemed a
patent lunatic; in the Western world he might be perfectly sane.
A modern Chinese faces thousands of such choices.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Peculiarities of Old China</a></em></p>

<p>Obviously, government in Republican China cannot be understood
without analysis of the foundations upon which it is built.
Such an analysis requires an inquiry, however cursory, into the
peculiarities of old China and those of contemporary China.
Some of the difficulties of modern China arise from the very
adequacy of the old system. Had the Chinese of the past been
less satisfied with their society, they might have become more
accustomed to change and transience.</p>

<p>China from the first millennium <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> occupied the central position
in the Far East. No other country in that part of the earth
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_3" title="pg 3"> </a>
was so powerful or so civilized. India, despite important contributions
to Chinese religious thought, was too far away to
impinge greatly upon the Chinese. Japan was heavily indebted
to the Chinese, and encouraged the Chinese in viewing themselves
as the most civilized of peoples. This had important consequences.
As China was unified most of the time, and as there
was no other polity to compare with the Chinese, their political
system took on the appearance of a universal empire. The
neighboring states paid formal tribute, and the Chinese were
unprepared to meet another people who might claim political
equality as an organized state. Even today, in the attitudes of
the Chinese and Japanese toward one another, there are strong
traces of this traditional point of view and indications that the
Japanese would like to restore a closed Far Eastern order with
themselves in supremacy.</p>

<p>Since old China was rarely confronted with international
problems, the Chinese were not aware of their realm as a nation-state.
There was no sharp territorial limit to the Chinese
polity, and no requirement that within certain boundaries one
authority be defined as supreme. The Chinese were able to
make their adjustments in the interplay of social and political
controls with less frequent resort to theory than the Westerners.
Nor was the Chinese ruler ever so firmly entrenched as to eliminate
the chance of being overthrown or to preclude the existence
of other&mdash;pluralistic&mdash;independent social controls. The power
of government was indeed limited. It maintained the peace of
the Chinese world, directed education, supported the social
proprieties, and was ornamental rather than efficient for the
greater part of its activities.</p>

<p>The Chinese lived primarily under the dominance of nonpolitical
agencies. These were the family (comparable to the
Western clan), the village and district, and the <em>hui</em> (association,
guild, society&mdash;in the narrowest sense of the term). The family
was intimately bound up with the Chinese religious system,
which stressed the continuity of each individual in the flesh.
A personal immortality was to be secured with greatest certainty
through the survival of one's own blood. The village was the
main economic unit, and the union of villages into districts
(<em>hsien</em>) provided an administrative division of importance: below
the <em>hsien</em> level, common interests were fostered by community
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_4" title="pg 4"> </a>
home rule; above it, by the government. This meant that
elders, clans in council, village bosses, and other nongovernmental
agencies carried on police work, all local public construction,
and most of the activities which are regarded in the modern
West as falling under the jurisdiction of the state. The <em>hui</em> was
able to supplement the family and the village; in guild form, it
provided the chief framework of commercial and industrial
organization.</p>

<p>If the government was weak and limited, and social control
ensured primarily by nongovernmental agencies, how did the
Chinese achieve so great a political stability? Why did their
polity not break up into a wilderness of tiny social groups, each
jealous and particularistic, like medieval Europe? The answer
is to be found in the psychological controls which the Chinese
established. They devised a system of indoctrination unequaled
by that of any other people.</p>

<p>The Chinese sought to guide men through the guidance of their
ideas: government by education, or government by propaganda.
For this purpose scholarship and administration were closely
allied. The government was made up of scholars, who thereby
occupied the position of greatest prestige in the society; the
scholars were trained to serve as government officials. Few
officials were not scholars; few scholars pursued a nonpolitical
course. This led to a profound uniformity of thought, and was in
accord with the dictates of the Confucian tradition.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>From the earliest times Chinese thought was social and political
in emphasis, rather than metaphysical and scientific. For
thousands of years scholars studied problems of society, government,
and ethics. They appealed to tradition, and interpreted
it. They organized the primitive religion of the Chinese into a
sophisticated social philosophy, and over the centuries their
work took effect. Chinese of different racial backgrounds, using
different spoken languages and unable to communicate with one
another by writing, living under different climatic and economic
conditions, came to show a startling uniformity of behavior.
Custom and common sense were woven into a solid pattern by
the scholars and accepted by the masses. Everything in human
life bore some relation to everything else, and the life of man was
related to the world of nature. There was no sharp distinction
between natural science and social philosophy.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_5" title="pg 5"> </a></p>

<p>The educational integration of government, mores, and
physical existence created a system of control which has exceeded
all others in lasting power. The group in command was the
scholastic bureaucracy, but membership in it was not hereditary.
Scholar-officials were recruited by civil service examinations,
and to this degree the society was a democratic one. Every
child in the society had the theoretical opportunity of becoming
prime minister. Furthermore, the power exercised by the
scholar-officials was different in its nature from that of legal
rulers in the West. Government was preventive rather than
remedial. Constitutionality was not confined to legal matters;
in a broader sense it extended to all subjects. The scholars were
as much subject to established tradition as the humblest Chinese,
and everyone knew the tradition. The scholars excelled only in
knowing it more thoroughly.</p>

<p>It may be stated as a truism that under any government the
actual scope of its intervention is confined to a certain category
of affairs, bounded on the one hand by matters which are so
trivial or so unexplored that they are left to the citizen's free
choice and on the other by subjects in which there is such general
agreement as to make political action unnecessary. This latter
sphere might be called ideological compliance&mdash;control of men
brought about by the inculcation of broad uniform patterns of
belief and behavior. If men are induced to agree upon a traditionally
fixed mode of behavior, they will unite in persecuting
dissenters and will not be conscious of the tyranny of ideological
doctrine. But if they think in many different ways, they will be
able to gain security only by promises of mutual noninterference.
Liberty&mdash;as absence of governmental restraint&mdash;may thus result
either from a complete concord, in which every man is free to
do as he wishes since all men wish to do basically the same, or
from a specific guarantee of each individual's freedom to follow
his own interest or caprice within a defined limit. The old
system of China was a free society in so far as dissent calling for
government interference was relatively negligible, and at the
same time a society rigidly controlled with respect to the uniformity
of individual behavior.</p>

<p>This tradition was pragmatic and realistic. The Chinese ideological
controls operated successfully because they corresponded
reasonably well with the actualities of social and economic existence.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" title="pg 6"> </a>
With the coming of the West, the old Chinese system
was affected in two ways: First, the amorphous Chinese society
was threatened by the strong, effectively organized states of the
West. Secondly, the competitive accomplishments of Western
civilization destroyed, in large part, the assumption of universality
upon which much Chinese tradition depended, and thereby
impaired the power of the scholar-officials. The twentieth
century brought China a new freedom, unaccustomed and
unsought. The old system was threatened with ruin, and
modern China faced the problem: replacement or reconstitution?
Or, more dangerously: chaos or political extinction?</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Peculiarities of Modern China</a></em></p>

<p>The lifetime of one man can span the gap between old China
and new. There are men living in Peking today who can remember
when the Forbidden City (the palace-city of the emperors)
was sacred and inviolate, and when the mandarinate ruled in
accordance with immemorial usage. These may regard all
Western science as a confusion, a wild torrent of exotic words,
which answers no problems, gives human life no aim and no
dignity, and is bound to return to the alien dust whence it came.
Opposing them are younger Chinese who hate the dead hand of
the past and look forward to a Westernized, scientific, industrial
China which will differ from Europe and America only in being
even more modern than they.</p>

<p>Most Chinese fall into neither of these groups. Many of them,
however, have a definite conception of the West and of the
benefits which Western civilization has to bestow. They also
realize the threat which it contains for those who do not master
it. Yet they have been nurtured in the serene humanity of
ancient custom and hold to it with the effortlessness of habit long
transmitted. Out of this dual standard there spring daily problems
of ethics and conduct, of private life and public policy.
Administrative organization versus family loyalty and nepotism,
promptness versus leisureliness, discipline versus courtesy: these
and many others are omnipresent antitheses.</p>

<p>Anachronism is China's second self. There is no set scheme of
things. Modern Western civilization has not been adopted so
fully as to make the traditional habits seem outmoded, nor has
the past survived to an extent as to make everything modern
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" title="pg 7"> </a>
appear ridiculous. The notion of world government, for example,
is gone from China, and the notion of multi-national government
not yet clear. The relation of the individual to society and
of the parts of society to the whole are not yet reformulated; this
affects such matters as criminal law, political organization, and
economic development. Virtually every adaptation in China
must be thought through from the beginning by the Chinese;
and even in thinking there are varying styles. Are the Chinese
to think after the fashion of the West&mdash;scientifically and logically&mdash;or
are they to think in their accustomed traditional and
empirical manner?</p>

<p>It is thus patent that the new Chinese world which is appearing
must grow out of the background of the past and the necessities
of the present. It cannot readily be planned because there are
not enough formulas common to the old Far Eastern and the new
Western worlds. New China must be a blending, from use,
from habit, from new skills imposed upon old. Out of the dangers
and misfortunes of the years since 1912 the Chinese have developed
a small body of political methods which is temporarily
workable. But the greater part of their social and governmental
thought and custom has yet to go through the process of reevaluation
by practice. Chinese political development has perforce to
be emergent and not planned.</p>

<p>According to either time scheme, that of her long past or of the
modern world, modern China is anachronistic. The transformation
of the Chinese world of the past to the China of the future
involves the creation of a whole set of transitional institutions
designed to lead from one to the other. Contemporary Chinese
institutions are neither those of the past nor those of the future;
they are a peculiar scheme of more recent origin and bound to be
replaced. Old China is gone. Modern China is novel and
unstable; in time it too will yield to a China of which prophecy
affords but few glimpses.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The World Significance of Chinese Government</a></em></p>

<p>If government in Republican China is an extemporized and
doomed system, rooted in no past, committed to no future, why
should it be scrutinized at all? A number of reasons for examining
Chinese government suggest themselves. Some of these
are of sufficient significance to merit statement, so as to suggest
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" title="pg 8"> </a>
facts and issues worthy of special notice. If certain points of key
importance are kept in mind, they may serve as references
whereby the relative ranking of any specific topic may be
ascertained.</p>

<p>First, the mere geographic extent of China is such as to make
her government necessary to a picture of contemporary governments.
At least every fifth human being now living is a Chinese.</p>

<p>Second, in international relations China has been of great
passive importance. The wars between Western and Far
Eastern nations have all been fought over the so-called Chinese
question. The partition of China and the open door in China
have been issues of international concern. Since 1931 the
Chinese have been active participants in the struggle for the control
of China, and the nature of their government determines in
large part the effectiveness of their resistance. China is a vast
market, and an even vaster reserve of man power&mdash;for troops or
for industrial labor.</p>

<p>Third, the pathology of government deserves attention.
Chronic social disorder may provide a great variety of political
facts wherewith to gauge the nature of political power. Well-governed
societies do not supply similar material because they
rarely need to probe political fundamentals.</p>

<p>Fourth, old China offers a challenging demonstration of
secular, civilian, pacific world government. The Chinese commonwealth
of the past was supernational; it seemed to the Chinese
like unified civilized humanity. Among the conflicting currents
of present world politics, there are some which drift toward world
unity; old China may present significant analogies to the international
institutions of today.</p>

<p>Fifth, the universal features of government may be more
fruitfully scrutinized in a novel cultural and social setting. China
presents a background radically different from the Western one,
and affords a unique test whereby Western political patterns and
those of world-wide significance may be distinguished from one
another.</p>

<p>Sixth, the question of method in political science may meet
qualifications after being applied to Chinese political thought.
The Chinese did not seek that illusory precision which has been
one of the chief goals of Western thought ever since logical
procedure was established by the Greeks. The Western man in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" title="pg 9"> </a>
the street, however, depends very little on mathematics or logic
in his everyday thinking. Indirectly, the effect of inductive and
deductive method has been revolutionary, but their importance
in routine operation or unspecialized thought is open to question&mdash;especially
in view of the findings of modern psychology. It
may well be that Chinese thought can assist in the interpretation
of everyday experience in the West, precisely because it is not
too specialized or scientific.</p>

<p>Seventh, the Chinese may contribute in a practical way to
political knowledge and leadership throughout the world.
These contributions may be anticipated by a consideration of
past and present Chinese government.</p>

<p>Eighth, the Chinese have lived in a peculiar historical environment,
consideration of which may broaden our outlook. Most
Western "world histories"&mdash;with few exceptions such as H. G.
Wells's brilliant <em>Outline</em>&mdash;are histories of the West Asiatic and
European worlds, with only perfunctory references to China.</p>

<p>The relative novelty of Chinese materials to Western research
explains in great part the neglect accorded them in the Western
social sciences. With the narrowing of the world by modern
means of transport and communication the situation is changing.
The science of Sinology (systematic study of China through
Chinese texts) has won its place among the archaeological disciplines.
Sinologists have made available to Westerners a great
deal of material, but its value depends in large part upon the
degree to which it is incorporated into the generally accessible
and usable body of knowledge.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Main Factors in Modern Chinese Government</a></em></p>

<p>In the consideration of modern Chinese government a somewhat
novel approach to government is called for: one which
distinguishes different elements and levels of control and makes
plain their interrelation. The narrow consideration of the
formal structure would be puzzling and discouraging, since the
various governments of modern China have been the ornaments
rather than the engines of political power. An attempt to
explain modern China in terms of constitutional legal development
alone would lead to exasperation or frustration; the ideological
and institutional context which might convey meaning
would be lost.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_10" title="pg 10"> </a></p>

<p>How can government be studied when politics are antecedent
to government? If the rulers make and unmake the form of
government almost at will, where is the real source of their power?
If armies can dissolve overnight and be reassembled under different
banners on the morrow, military power may seem tenuous and
dependent on other factors. What are these? If property is
insecure and the standards of wealth subject to variation, how
can economic power be treated as an ultimate determinant?
How do men wield authority of any sort, while they create or
destroy the machinery of authority?</p>

<p>For centuries China had been held together by a close-knit
system dependent upon tradition. This tradition, the ideology
called <em>Confucian</em>, was the device whereby the scholar-officials
of the old imperial bureaucracy controlled society. Government
itself was subordinate to the moral and social leadership of the
intellectuals, who relegated the economic and military professions
to the less honored categories of society. The whole fabric of
Chinese life was made up of interlocking patterns; the West, by
destroying a part, tore the whole asunder. Modern China faces
more than political problems; a totalitarian revolution has
engulfed it. China has been proceeding not from partial control
to complete control, as are Italy,<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
Germany,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
and the Soviets,<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
but from complete control to something not far from universal
license&mdash;freedom all-pervading, unwanted, and terrifying. The
problem of modern Chinese government is the problem of
re-creating government out of its raw materials: land, people,
doctrine, force, and law.</p>

<p>In this problem certain factors stand forth as preeminent: ideological
movements, military and economic factors, governments.</p>

<p>First, the movements. These supplant the ancient tradition
and the old hierarchy of scholars. In the place of one settled
authority over all subjects, there suddenly appeared thousands of
little authorities. Anarchism, dress reform, Christianity, feminism,
nationalism, pro-Japanism, communism, atheism, capitalism&mdash;discordant
and partially contradictory, these all compete
for the authority or a part of the authority once held by the old
system. China undergoes intellectual, moral, educational,
political, economic, military, scientific, and industrial revolutions
all at once, and all for the same reason&mdash;the passing of the old
unified order. Imagine the Renaissance, the Reformation,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_11" title="pg 11"> </a>
the French Revolution, the industrial revolution, the Gold Rush
of '49, the World War, and the Russian Revolution all happening
in the same country in the same generation! This is a common-place
comparison, frequently made. Movements determined the
loyalty of troops, the title to property, the form of government.
Power inhered in them, since they determined the conditions
under which men would seek and wield power. A great part of
the control of China has been exerted directly, by means of the
movements themselves.</p>

<p>Second, the armies took the power which goes with military
force, simply because theirs was military force. They did not
have to seek power. It accrued to them, out of the disorder of
society. Along with military power went economic power as the
most tangible and negotiable. Guns and property seem very
realistic indices of power, as long as the troops are loyal and the
property safe from confiscation or devaluation.</p>

<p>Third, the governments. Between ideological movements,
which sought to rebuild the ideas and habits of men, and armies
wielding a brief but nearly unrestricted authority, government
played its tertiary role. It was at times of ludicrous unimportance,
and on some occasions possessed power in its own right.
It leaped to a sharply improved position after 1928, but never
possessed the generality of assent or the monopoly of force to
the degree common in the West.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Approach</a></em></p>

<p>Government may mean the control (or attempted control) of
society by men professing to act in the name of all society. In
this sense it includes propagandists and educators who seek to
reconstitute society, leaders of movements, soldiers, economic
leaders of all classes, and government leaders (so far as they use
government establishments as an actual means of control).
Viewed thus, the political processes of modern China are manifold
and significant. Here is power stripped naked, power without
ornament, power resting squarely upon the brains or guns of
men. Men rise and fall in the contest for power; they rise and
fall absolutely, not in a fictitious scheme which establishes a
fictitious order of constitutional offices sometimes providing
asylum for popular leaders in eclipse.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" title="pg 12"> </a></p>

<p>Government may also mean the structure and function of
that formally organized group in society which claims to act
upon the mandate of legal sovereignty. When the concept of
sovereignty itself is vague, confused, or absent, government by
title may be merely one among several factors of power. Government
in China is broader than the governments of China; the
two should be distinguished from one another.</p>

<p>In outlining government in Republican China, the present
analysis follows the broader construction of the word <em>government</em>.
The governments proper are accordingly discussed in the last
part, the first two being devoted to the ideological movements
and to the military and economic factors. For the purpose of
defining the three sets of controls as clearly as possible, each is
treated separately. This has necessitated a corresponding
arrangement of the historical data, though in each part presented
from a different point of view. But it is highly desirable that the
long-range Chinese chronology be kept in mind. To this end a
table of Chinese dynasties has been provided.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">5</a></sup> As a result of
separate analysis the movements, the armies, and the governments
may appear in bolder relief than would otherwise be
possible, and the role of government in the broadest sense may
be made clearer, not only for China but for the West as well.</p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> I</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">CONFUCIANISM</a></h2>


<p>The continuity of Chinese civilization depends not alone upon
its political virtues, but upon its working effectiveness in all
relevant spheres of human activity. In emphasizing certain
aspects of old China, it is impossible to trace the entire broad
evolution.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6">1</a></sup> In fact, the emergence of those devices which, along
with government in the narrow sense, guided China in her long
past dates back to prehistory. Throughout the ages, however,
Chinese life has preserved its identity.</p>

<blockquote><p>Chinese culture is unique in its continuity. Its most striking characteristic
is a capacity for change without disruption. It would appear
that that characteristic goes back even to [those] cultures which preceded
the Shang in northeast China. Shang culture, like all great cultures,
was eclectic, fertilized by influences from many quarters. But these
influences and techniques, when they were accepted, met the same fate
which has overtaken every people, every religion, every philosophy
which has invaded China. They were taken up, developed to accord
with Chinese conditions, and transmuted into organic parts of a culture
which remained fundamentally and characteristically Chinese.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7">2</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>This is the comment of H. G. Creel, an American Sinologue who
has helped to explain the archaeological sites of a Chinese
civilization considerably older than any other. Even in its
historical beginnings the civilization of man in China displayed
features corresponding to that of the modern Chinese.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Ages before Confucius</a></em></p>

<p>The earliest Chinese state known is the Hsia, which is traditionally
termed a dynasty in the Chinese chronicles and given the
dates 2205-1765 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> More critical examination of the materials
of Chinese tradition, the excavation of the engraved bones and
bronzes from succeeding periods, and an interpretation of Chinese
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" title="pg 14"> </a>
history with the technique of modern archaeology have upset the
credibility of the records of the earliest periods. All that is established
is the fact that the Hsia was a state before the Shang. It
is unlikely that Hsia exercised any imperial hegemony over other
peoples, since the empire system did not rise till Chou times.</p>

<p>Of the Shang dynasty (traditionally 1765-1123 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) much
more is known. Thirty years ago most Western scholars
thought the Shang chronicles to be myth, but excavations in
northeast China have located a Shang capital and have unearthed
a large body of inscriptions on bone.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8">3</a></sup> The Shang culture must
have been highly developed, possessing an urban life, writing,
and a definite system of monarchical government. The germs
of scholastic leadership were present. Power was in the hands
of a single ruler (<em>wang</em>, or king), who claimed hegemony for an
undetermined distance beyond the walls of the capital.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> the Shang dynasty was overthrown
by conquerors from the west, the Chou. The Chou
dynasty bridges the gap between the semihistoric and the
definitely historic period of Chinese antiquity. Under the
Chou the chief features of Chinese social and intellectual existence
took on clear form. From the Chou conquest and their attempts
to establish stable government China derived striking social
and political characteristics. One of the astonishing facts about
early Chinese history is the manner in which the Chou rulers
utilized propaganda to make their conquest secure, and in which
their propaganda furnished dynamic concepts of Chinese social
thought and development.</p>

<p>The most important of these widely propagandized concepts
was that of the Chinese Empire. The city of Shang had been
the center of a dominion which could not possibly have included
more than a fraction of what is known today as China. The
civilized areas along the Yellow River were probably no larger
than Palestine. Most of what is now China was conquered in
succeeding centuries. Even in this small area, it is not known
what relationship existed between the ruler of Shang and other
rulers. The Chou monarchs built up the legend that the Shang
rulers had occupied a position of primacy among the rulers of the
civilized world, and then claimed the position themselves by
right of succession through conquest. There was thus fostered
the notion of one ruler, central and supreme.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="pg 15"> </a></p>

<p>Secondly, the Chou themselves taught the doctrine of the
right of revolution. They identified their god with the Shang
god instead of declaring that their god had overwhelmed the
other. They asserted that this one god had been displeased by
the profligacy and wickedness of the Shang and had called upon
the Chou to overthrow the Shang rulers. Both these theories,
refined and amplified, became fundamentals of Chinese political
thought in later ages.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="r9">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The Chou established a system of government which left an
imprint on Chinese politics for three thousand years. In relating
their metropolitan administration to their occupation of the lands
of North and Central China they were less successful. Lacking
any other device of government, they turned to feudalism, and on
the quasi-feudal foundations of the Shang they imposed a fief
system. This led first to the division of China into many small
feudal units and later to the appearance of powerful territorial
states. The first of these periods-that in which feudalism
predominated-was known as the Ch'un Ch'iu, or Spring and
Autumn epoch (770-473 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>). The second&mdash;in which the
states developed&mdash;was known as the Chan Kuo, or Warring
States epoch (473-221 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>).</p>

<p>The rise of the Chou provided China with her first government
on an imperial scale and with the beginnings of a theory concerning
the nature of imperial government. The increasing disorganization
during the Ch'un Ch'iu and Chan Kuo periods led
to the development of the Confucian and other philosophies,
wherein the Chinese, conscious of political shortcomings, sought
the good society.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Ideology Called Confucian</a></em></p>

<p>551 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> is most commonly given as the year of Confucius'
birth. Confucius (K'ung Ch'iu; also Master K'ung&mdash;K'ung
Fu-tz&#365;, from which Confucius is derived) was a wandering
scholar and would-be official whose life was spent in the advocacy
of political and social reform. He was important because of
his part in establishing the profession of teaching and for his
doctrines upholding good government. Discontented with the
present, he turned to the past&mdash;becoming conservative and
aristocratic in outlook. His position in the history of political
thought he owes to the bent which he gave aristocratic conservatism.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" title="pg 16"> </a>
He sought the leadership of the <em>ch&uuml;n-tz&#365;</em> (the upright,
superior, or aristocratic man) rather than the domination of
laws. He developed an ethical system secular and practical in
its orientation and humane in its tenets. He emphasized the
necessity of the individual's appropriate self-consciousness in
the society, and the need for following <em>li</em> (propriety), the established
values. He stressed family loyalty above all others, and
insisted on respect for tradition. After his death in 479 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
his ideas were elaborated, clarified, and revised into what is
known as the <em>Confucian system</em>.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="r10">5</a></sup></p>

<p>This system underwent many changes. The Confucian influences
came to prevail in the Han dynasty, in the second and first
centuries <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, but lost its official preeminence with the fall
of the Han in the third century. It nevertheless retained a great
share of intellectual leadership. In the Sung period (960-1279)
the philosopher Chu Hsi developed Confucianism into its most
recent accepted form. Others joined him in sharpening and
refining Confucianism.</p>

<p>The Sung philosophers evolved a Confucianism which showed
the influence of the Taoist and Buddhist philosophies. They
reinterpreted the classics by emphasizing works other than those
hitherto regarded as preeminent. With reference to the concept
<em>li</em>, they developed the notion of a truly complete order running
through both spirit and matter. Metaphysics, alien to the mind
of Confucius himself, became an operative part of Confucian
thought. Through their ethical and psychological studies the
Sung Confucians translated the Confucian rationale into an
effective ideological technique for domination. It is not inconsistent
to find them opposing any action definitely governmental.
Furthermore, they showed themselves to be conservatives in
politics, and through their commentaries on the classics&mdash;which
were studied in succeeding centuries along with the texts themselves&mdash;imprinted
their conservatism upon the Chinese mind.</p>

<p>The ideology called <em>Confucian</em> is not identical with Confucianism
as the philosophic system proper. In the first place,
it is not known how much of the social doctrines taught by
Confucius and his successors was original and how much mere
transmission of preexisting beliefs. Confucius himself regarded
his work as that of a transmitter and not a creator. Secondly,
the whole Chinese culture contributed elements of strength to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" title="pg 17"> </a>
the ideology to which the name of Confucius became attached
by Westerners. Thirdly, the system developed in practice to
an extent which Confucius could not have anticipated. The
Confucian ideology and society bear the relation to Confucius
which Christendom bears to Jesus Christ; both founders would
scarcely recognize the derivations to which their teachings have
led.</p>

<p>The Confucian ideology came to prevail in China just before
the day of Christ. At the time of Christ, Wang Mang, a usurper
and a zealous Confucian, shook the Han Empire with his experiments.
A period of reaction against Confucianism set in.
Taoism and Buddhism provided rival cults. After the twelfth
century, Confucianism rose slowly to power over men's minds
again&mdash;although it had never been wholly superseded by other
doctrines, it had long lacked its all-compelling primacy. Not
until the Ming dynasty (1368-1643) did it become the state
philosophy of China, the ideology whereby China lived politically
and whereby she was governed.</p>

<p>Descriptions of Confucian China apply, therefore, with
particular cogency to the past five hundred years, if account is
taken of the role of Confucianism as a state philosophy. But
if those elements of Chinese culture which are subsumed under
the name of Confucianism are considered apart from Confucian
philosophy, the time may be extended indefinitely. Confucian
doctrine is one aspect of Chinese culture which has in various
centuries risen to the forefront. Underneath this doctrine
there are tenets, near the level of unconscious habit, which
apply to almost all ages of China. It is difficult to separate
the two phenomena and to distinguish between Chinese culture
and its most representative philosophy. An analogy, remote
but suggestive, is the influence of Aristotle in the West. Periods
of Aristotelian predominance can be distinguished from the
general history of Western thought, in which Aristotle plays a
consistent but lesser role. As Aristotle was interpreted by
Aquinas, so was Confucianism by the Sung philosophers. Aristotelian
politics are far removed from the specific problems of
representative or modern authoritarian government; nevertheless
they possess great value and exercise an indeterminable influence
upon the entire West. The analogy holds for China if left in
its loosest terms. Confucianism is far from oblivion. The
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="pg 18"> </a>
China which met the Western impact&mdash;"old China" in the eyes
of the twentieth century&mdash;was in fact more Confucian than
was the West Aristotelian. She was permeated by an ideology
in which Confucius' teachings were the key pattern, though not
one which he had made up in its entirety.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Government in the Confucian Ideology</a></em></p>

<p>In Confucian China, government was reduced to a minimum.
There existed a set of institutions which in many respects
afforded a remarkable although misleading parallel to the
governments of the West. In fact, the earliest Western visitors
to China found no difficulty in applying their own political
language to China. The supreme Chinese leader they called
the <em>emperor</em>, despite the inevitable Caesarian connotations of
the term and the fact that it erased the peculiar significance
of the Chinese title. Subordinate areas were called <em>provinces</em>.
All the way through, the use of European concepts compelled
whole series of unwarranted parallels. The term <em>mandarin</em>
forced its way into Western tongues, however, since there was
no existing term to describe the members of the curious hierarchy
of scholar-bureaucrats occupying a position of hegemony among
the institutions of Chinese society. Unfortunately for Chinese
as well as Westerners, both were so poorly informed in the
beginnings of intercourse that the Chinese could not secure an
adequate picture of Europe, while the Europeans assumed that
the Chinese were more, rather than less, like themselves. The
Chinese society, with a single supreme ritual leader, was termed
an <em>empire</em>, and the predominant hierarchy of that society a
<em>government</em>.</p>

<p>Actually, modern political scientists would have to hesitate
before applying the term <em>government</em> to the hierarchy of old China.
In many respects that hierarchy was more like Europe's medieval
universities and our fraternal societies than the governments of
the West. The prestige accruing to positions in the system was
not derived so much from political power as from the status
which the system offered to its members. An official, although
he might value his power, was regarded in the society at large
almost as much for what he was as for the dignity with which
the office invested him. This arose from his peculiar role, in
which his function was to provide a model of propriety in his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="pg 19"> </a>
private and public life rather than to interfere in the lives of
others. Interference, to be sure, occurred&mdash;sharply, Draconically,
directed more against the social group of the offender
than against the offender himself, on the theory that it was the
function of the group to keep its members in line with the
common-sense traditions. In such rare cases the officialdom
became a government&mdash;government as the institution of men who
seek to control society in the name of all society. Normally
the officialdom was not a government in this sense, as it claimed
leadership rather than control, preached rather than punished,
shamed rather than intimidated the people.</p>

<p>Confucius said, "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity
sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid
the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by
virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of
propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will
become good."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">6</a></sup> In a governmental system which was avowedly
Confucian, the officials were discouraged from trying to formulate
rules, for such rules, if specific, could only duplicate the enactments
of custom and, if general, might entangle the official in a
web of words. If the officials were personally and individually
worthless, there would be no hope for good government and the
only remedy would consist in selecting good officials and placing
them in high positions. If the officials were good, their integrity
and common sense would show them the solutions to problems
and they would have no need to solicit advice from some manual
of commands. No lifeless paper and ink could guide a people
unless there were upright officials to study the classics and put
the judicious rules found in them into effect. The only safeguard
against bad government was good government by good
men; the only remedy for bad government was the effort of good
men. The Chinese never set up an imaginary machinery and
turned themselves into its cogs. To the simple, common-sense
humanity of the Confucians, a government made up of
rigid laws&mdash;a system having no reference to the personality or
value of individuals, but embedded in a vast mechanism of
numbers&mdash;would have seemed anathema and lunacy.</p>

<p>Government in China was an auxiliary activity, the reserve
power of a hierarchy given to the pursuit of different ends.
The officials were teachers first and magistrates afterward;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_20" title="pg 20"> </a>
the emperor was a supreme model first and a ruler afterward;
the people were shamed, and punished only when
they were shameless. Such was the ideal theory upon which
the Chinese built their world society. The facts were rarely
as bright as they might have hoped; the reserve power never
disappeared.</p>

<p>The necessity for government did not always proceed from the
frailties of the governed. The Confucian system, although
worthy of its great esteem, was marked by the difficulties which
attend all human organization. Corruption and tyranny
appeared, and were not by any means negligible. In many
cases it may be supposed that a system of laws would have
provided redress for individuals treated arbitrarily or unjustly;
but, if one is to judge by experience in the West, even law
brings with it other types of injustice peculiar to itself. In
China some of the most benevolent and effective emperors
advocated at times a government of rules and not of men, in
order to check the caprice and the oppression of officials; yet
the role of law in China, in contrast to the part it has played in
the West, remained slight. The West affords instances of effective
political work outside legal systems, while the Chinese have
produced law codes of considerable breadth and significance.
Nevertheless, the power of Chinese government aside from law
is just as clear as the Western development of government
within law.</p>

<p>The old Chinese system was based upon control through ideas,
control exercised through the maintenance of clear notions of
right and wrong, as founded in certain well-established common-sense
traditions. The world of fact and the world of right and
wrong were bound together, and the whole ideology was one of
general and all-pervasive order. While the Western impact
was felt cumulatively through the nineteenth century, the
Chinese world of fact went down into the limbo of myth in a
few disestablished generations, and with it went the compulsion
which Confucian common sense had exerted.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="r12">7</a></sup> The consequent
development of new ways of acting, which had nothing to do
with traditional control, upset the entire scheme. When the
system of ideological guidance began breaking down, there was a
stampede to get away from it. Men no longer trusted it, no
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" title="pg 21"> </a>
longer trusted the tameness of their neighbors. A new wildness,
a savagery armed with science, had come with the aliens from
beyond the seas. It was the old hierarchy to which men turned,
calling it <em>the state</em>.</p>

<p>As a state, as an all-embracing control institution, the old
Chinese hierarchy was a pseudomorph&mdash;it looked like a state
but was not really one. Now it had to develop those characteristics
of regularity, impersonality, and machine effectiveness
demanded of a state in the modern world. It had to restore
the virtue of men by telling them how it was possible to be
virtuous in a world in which all things turned and changed with
the days and not with the centuries. It had to gather together
the members of the old Chinese world-community, reorient them
with respect to the new, divided world around them, and fight
off the inroads of outsiders. Above everything else, it had to
grow strong, so that it might institute order, so that it might
someday grow weak again. On the other hand, if a governmental
system were set up which tried to maintain the precarious
supremacy that Western states have enjoyed, and which was
subject to uncontrolled fluctuations in the thought of the people
upon whom it rested, the Chinese might lose their character as
Chinese. They might be absorbed into the Western world
and become a group of yellow-skinned traditionless men, living
according to the heritage of white men's laws and doomed to a
perpetual inferiority because these laws were not their own.
They might be aliens upon the earth, with no group to call their
own. Such a nightmarish vision may have come to Sun Yat-sen
when he pleaded with all his heart for the unification and defense
of a China still Chinese.</p>

<p>The old system broke and collapsed in 1911-1912. This
collapse was hastened by the fact that the imperial family was
incapable of leadership. A succession of degenerates and
children occupied the throne&mdash;the one intelligent emperor was
imprisoned by a clique&mdash;and a fanatical old woman held enough
power to keep anyone else from using it, but not enough to lead
or to want to lead a revolution from above. When the old
structure caved in, over four hundred million people were
without effective government, and no one really knew how to
create it.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="pg 22"> </a></p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Replacement of the Confucian Ideology</a></em></p>

<p>Only some of the movements which have occurred in China
have had political significance. With the collapse of the old
stable order, the Chinese fell into great confusion, devoting
themselves to a variety of doctrines and crusades. Some of
these movements may be regarded as subordinate to the day-to-day
struggle for military or governmental power; others, though
within the sphere of politics as far as their interests were concerned,
never acquired sufficient importance to impress themselves
upon the general political scene.</p>

<p>The only movements which need be here considered are constituent
ones. It has been noted that the real basis for the
stability and operation of the old Chinese society lay not in the
power of an organized body of law-makers, law-enforcers, and
law-interpreters but in the constitutionalism of common sense, in
the deep harmony of agreement which the Confucian outlook
on fact and value had created. Men were raised tame, and what
tamed them was an ideology&mdash;a unified, coherent body of ideas&mdash;which
related the knowledge of the world to the sphere of morals,
which was applied by the intellectually dominant classes as a
means of control, and which secured for the controlling classes
hegemony over all groups in society.</p>

<p>The moment the old order weakened, it was inevitable that
men would try to find substitutes which met four criteria: (1)
a plausibly satisfactory explanation for the world of fact; (2) a
persuasively related scheme of values (right, wrong; good, bad);
(3) use of this explanation and the value scheme (both together
forming an ideology) to control behavior; (4) authoritative
status of the individuals promoting the ideology, whether or
not organized as a group.</p>

<p>It will be recognized that these criteria fit the great religious
movements of mankind; it is equally apparent that they lend
themselves to the promotion of governance. Governing under
conditions of ideological anarchy is at best a precarious effort&mdash;a
makeshift, a pitiable building upon sand. The Western
world faces today the same problem that the Chinese face:
How are men to agree widely enough to live together in peace?
But the Chinese approached this problem from an experience of
deliberately fostered agreement. Confucianism had the effectiveness
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" title="pg 23"> </a>
of the great religions and a sophistication and malleability
superior, perhaps, to any of them. As a consequence,
the modern Chinese were keenly aware of the necessity of the
last two criteria. The problem of ideological guidance is only
half solved with the presentation of a new scheme of facts and a
new scheme of morals; propaganda and institutionalization
remain.</p>

<p>Complaints are current in the West to the effect that art,
science, and letters are becoming propaganda&mdash;that is, that they
are being used to control men, or as attempts to control men.
The Chinese of 1912 and after never had similar scruples. All
human effort was propaganda, and whatever was not, was of
only passing interest. There was no alternative while the
Chinese tried to found a new common sense in the discredited
ruins of their old world order. Their natural science had been
impeached by the demonstrable superiority of Western science.
Their code of ethics, whatever its aesthetic appeal, was ineffectual
as a way of conduct among people who had different, more
violent notions of right and wrong. Even the code of personal
behavior&mdash;the elaborate courtesies, the leisureliness, the grace
of life in old China&mdash;was worthless in an environment which put
a high premium upon speed, impersonality, efficiency. As
the Chinese turned to a revision of all aspects of their mode
of life at once, different groups, trying to find some one key
reform which would solve all difficulties, fell into discord. Economic
advance, political reorganization, "realism" in outlook,
educational reform&mdash;all these had their adherents. None was
allowed, by either adherents or opponents, to stand simply as
a group of separate reform measures to be considered on their
own merits; the drive for a new ideology made all proposals
important for their bent rather than their content. A simple
thing like the desirability of using Latin letters in mass education
immediately took on a vast significance when related to the
<em>Kulturpolitik</em> of the time. The left-wingers once attacked the
missionaries who had first tried to introduce it, on the ground
that the missionaries were seeking to prostitute the Chinese
mind and to make the Chinese betray the past. Later the
Communists enthusiastically pushed the same scheme, stating
that the Chinese ideographs were a stronghold of reactionary
thought. The torments of the struggle inevitably caused the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="pg 24"> </a>
terms of conflict to resolve; gradually several more or less
determinant movements emerged, around which all other reforms
tended to cluster, because of sympathy or logical relationship.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Chief Movements in the Rebuilding of China</a></em></p>

<p>Among the movements, Confucianism stands first. Even
with its limpness and decadence, it still represents the greatest
single intellectual force in the country. To the Chinese, this
force may not even be apparent, and they take it as much for
granted as the air they breathe. Nevertheless, the outside
observer can see that even though Confucianism is inert as a
movement, its inertia is more important than the pressures of
other causes. Unconsciously, the Chinese accept whole tracts
of Confucian thought. They accept, in other words, the guidance
of Confucian ideology in much the same way that Americans
who are not churchgoers still accept the major premises of
Christianity, simply because their whole environment is charged
with it. Just as in the West a universal and potent Christian
revival in politics is not likely but is nevertheless conceivable,
so in China it is not very probable but quite possible that there
will be a successful resurrection of the orthodox Confucian
philosophy. Whether a strict Confucianism could return
without monarchy is doubtful; and Sun Yat-sen's blend of
republicanism and Confucianism is so well established that
it may prevent the successful promotion of uninterpreted
Confucianism.</p>

<p>The Taoists and Buddhists are similarly inactive in politics.
More strictly concerned with the supernatural than is Confucianism,
they represent significant tangential forces upon the
flow of political development, but do not express themselves in
overt intervention. Among the leaders of all groups except the
Communists there are important members of both sects. It is
not uncommon for any of them, defeated in war or temporarily
eliminated from politics, to turn to a monastery and study ancient
texts, much in the way that an idle American politician goes to a
farm, cultivating his health and his reputation.</p>

<p>Islam is a minor but living force in China. It has long prevailed
in the border territories of the Northwest, and for generations
has presented vital and effective opposition to the Chinese
influence. The territory of the Mohammedans was consequently
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" title="pg 25"> </a>
a hotbed of rebellion and separatism, until the ghastly religious
wars of the past century drowned autonomous tendencies in an
ocean of blood. At the present time the Islamic movement
faces another equal to itself in ferocity and persuasiveness&mdash;Marxism&mdash;in
Outer Mongolia, across the border in the U. S. S. R.,
and in the northwest controlled by the Chinese Red Army.
Thus far Islam has given no promise of power.</p>

<p>Nationalism&mdash;the movement launched by Sun Yat-sen, which
follows his doctrines of the <em>San Min Chu I</em><sup><a href="#fn13" id="r13">8</a></sup>&mdash;is the official
movement of the National Government of China and of the
Nationalist armies under Chiang K'ai-shek. It is consequently
the chief power of positive action in the whole country. At
various times, Sun's followers have been known as Progressives,
Revolutionists, Republicans, and Nationalists&mdash;according to
the phase of their program then uppermost.</p>

<p>Opportunism, rationalized by one or another ornamental
philosophy, has been very common in modern China. It has
accepted ideological materials the way they are used in superficial
struggles of the West&mdash;making ideals fit the facts and using them
for the sake of the facts. Opportunism has been characterized
by the avid acceptance of wholly implausible doctrines, or by a
disingenuous "realism." Proalien and defeatist movements
have been opportunist in practical matters; "strong man"
philosophies have served the causes of individual ambitions.
Ideologically these currents were noteworthy only because they
stirred up the mud, making genuine intellectual clarification
all the more difficult.</p>

<p>Finally, three important movements have come from outside.
These are Christianity, Marxism, and pro-Japanism.</p>

<p>Each sociopolitical movement in China has had economic
connections. Some movements are avowedly bourgeois and
capitalist and find their roots in Western tradition. Others are
inspired by the challenge of the land problem, which is very acute.
World production has upset Chinese farm prices; international
trade has ruined many peasant craft industries; modern armies
have imposed unprecedented tax burdens; opium and erosion
ruin large portions of the people and the land. In some cases
the chaos in the countryside can only be stilled by massacre.
Despite the presence of capitalist, proletarian, and agrarian
economic movements, it seems likely that economic questions
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="pg 26"> </a>
will be settled by groups which do not concentrate upon them
to the exclusion of all others. Meanwhile, each of the movements
seeking to create a new China will have to provide for reform
or replacement of the economic system, which is decrepit because
of its internal decline and the appearance of economic devices
from the West vastly more effective, but inconsistent with
Chinese modes of existence.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Confucianism in the Republic</a></em></p>

<p>Confucianism as an official movement has been used to support
other tendencies, to further the opportunist activities of particular
cliques, and to bolster&mdash;by disguising&mdash;the Japanese occupation
of Manchuria. It is incorrect, however, to limit the role of
Confucianism in modern China to these facts. In serving as a
foundation for other movements it possesses unmeasured
potentialities.</p>

<p>Confucianism supposes that the truth and the socially desirable
are identical; that both are identical with the Confucian tradition;
and that an elite of scholars is required to propagate
truth, clothing it with the language of tradition and morality.
Confucianism is hostile to the very notion of sovereignty, leaves
no room for a system of permanently separate nations, and is
unable to accommodate the Western idea of an accidental growth
in knowledge, dependent upon sporadic individual initiative.
Confucianism is strong in so far as it promotes a society based
upon knowledge, in which individuals can ascend or descend
according to their personal virtue and competence. Such an
ideal has a definite end in the physical universe by working
toward a human immortality of the flesh and the spirit&mdash;flesh
through the perpetuation of the family name in the male line,
spirit through the transmission of records and knowledge. Its
present-day defects are obvious. The world of fact in the
Confucian ideology does not correspond with the beliefs accepted
as fact by the dominant West. The intellectual insulation
against the outside necessary to ideological control could not
be achieved by any single modern nation without the use of
tyranny. Moreover, Confucian ethics and politics, more than
twenty-four centuries old, can scarcely be expected to conform
to the changed minutiae of human life, dominated by technology.
Nevertheless, while the Chinese may not turn again to the classics
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" title="pg 27"> </a>
for guidance in concrete situations, or consult ancient authorities
for solutions to simple practical problems, the moral and social
doctrines of Confucianism, redefined or modified, could well
play a definite role in the modern world. In China the chief
rivals to Confucianism will be the new heterodox schools of
reinterpreted Confucianism&mdash;such as the versions posed by
Sun Yat-sen and Chiang K'ai-shek, or the watery Confucianism
of Manchoukuo.</p>

<p>The nonformal unorganized power of Confucianism weighs
more heavily. If Confucianism were to be considered alone
on the strength of the movements featuring the password
"Back to Confucius!" it would be so negligible as to merit no
attention. Not the strength of its partisans but the concessions
of its opponents and rivals make Confucianism important.
Confucius can no more be eradicated from modern China than
Plato, Aristotle, and Christ from the background of Western
society. Every Chinese movement, starting with Confucianism
as the status quo, will have to incorporate a large part of the
traditional doctrines. It may well be that in the new breeds of
thought the Confucian strain will prove dominant and most
lasting.</p>

<p>Until the breakdown of the Empire, Confucian texts were
studied appreciatively rather than critically. One does not
criticize common sense unless one is anxious for the reputation
of a crank. With the blinding dawn of Western knowledge,
Confucianism went into the wastebasket. Two years in New
York were worth a generation of study over the ancient authorities.
From time to time, under the Republic, the various governments
discussed plans for educational reform, or haphazardly
encouraged the dying traditionalist schools; but nothing could
restore the prestige of classicism. Strangely, the greatest
impetus toward classical learning was provided by the challengers
of the classics. Modern Chinese scholarship, using Western
methods of critical study, and armed with new specializations
undreamed of by the archaists, found that the traditional
authorities were valuable not only for what they pretended to
be&mdash;plain, direct, factual records&mdash;but also as source material
for penetrating interpretations.</p>

<p>The Chinese have turned to this task since the opening of the
various scientific agencies of the National Government at
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="pg 28"> </a>
Nanking and have already produced works of importance on
their own past. They have pushed back their scientifically
ascertainable history almost a thousand years. The modern
Chinese students, who hated the classics when they were mouthed
by sedate old scholars ignorant of the modern world, now devote
themselves to the classics to criticize them; criticizing them,
they study them; studying them, they love them. The "science
of the country" (Sinology) has recently been added to the
curriculum of the modern schools; it is causing a veritable
renaissance. In fact, the Chinese are constantly becoming
more anxious to find precedent for political growth and development
in their own past rather than in the past of the West, which
they could never appreciate as much as do Westerners.</p>

<p>The actual Confucian movements do not warrant attention.
Militarists have sponsored little Confucian coteries, or have paid
for the publication of sumptuous editions of the Confucian
classics, with the expectation of acquiring a reputation for
benevolence and intelligence. Wu P'ei-fu, the most accomplished
scholar among the military leaders of his period, who
owed part of his prestige to his scholarship, was diligent in
promoting Confucianism. With his decline (1926) his example
was no longer felt to be worth following; Confucianism as a
practical political expedient passed from the scene. It gave too
little sanction to the raising of local conscript armies, inflation
of the currency, and the doubling of taxes. Its complete silence
on such necessities could not be taken for consent.</p>

<p>In the Japanese-occupied territory in Manchuria, however,
an interesting experiment in Confucianism has been made.
The customs and organization of the last Chinese dynasty have
been resurrected, touched up by a few classical scholars, given a
somewhat more orthodox and unrealistic air, and proclaimed as
the constitution of the Great Empire of Manchou (Manchoukuo).
Since the effective government of the country is under strong
Japanese influence, the venture is significant only as a political
narcotic. The laws proclaimed are in Chinese; the officials'
names are Chinese; the miranda of government, whatever the
fact, are consistent with the grand traditions of Chinese history.
The Japanese might have placed a handful of dreaming reactionaries
in actual power and helped the growth of an anachronistic
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_29" title="pg 29"> </a>
Chinese Empire in the northeast, but they seem to
have spoiled their opportunity of creating a friendly and subservient
state by acting too arbitrarily and making it impossible
for the Confucian experiment to work.</p>

<p>Confucianism in modern China owes its position not so much
to its prospects as to the fact that it has provided a frame of
reference, however obsolescent, for the political struggle. Hence,
through the tumultuous modern period, the Chinese have been
strengthened by a philosophy which emphasized the separateness
and stability of each institution in society, and which did not
make them lose all with the fortunes of a single supreme organization.
As a positive political force, Confucianism has done two
things: It has kept the Chinese from depending too much on political
control, and it has provided a rationale in the contest for power.
It accomplished the first by making police a function of society
as a whole, by stressing the appropriateness of behavior rather
than its legality; and it has given the Chinese ethical values
despite their sorry political condition. Confucianism has
rationalized struggle by supplying each individual participant
with a code to apply if he came to power, and by giving him a
good pretense for seeking power. Confucius himself lived in
a time when Chinese political organization was chaotic. He
noted the need for righteous men in high places and pointed out
the good which could be done, apart from general reform, by
the furtherance of virtue through scattered efforts. Confucius
supplied the ambitious men of his own time with a reason for
aspiring to power&mdash;by making political responsibility a duty for
the man of intelligence. The Confucian scholar was no saint
contemplating eternity; he was a proud, correct, self-righteous,
patient individual, obliged by his training to take public office
wherein his talent could gain wide influence.</p>

<p>In modern China, the seekers of political office have been
able to avoid the appearance of abject venality by professing
respectability. Even though they may have been just as corrupt
as the politicians of other nations, and more efficiently so,
they nevertheless had the saving grace to eschew hard realism
and cloak their ambition with a pleasantly virtuous tradition. A
military leader could surround himself with a few scholars
and give his efforts to reach power the air of a mild and well-mannered
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="pg 30"> </a>
crusade. Whenever political strife in China has had
no meaning but vanity and greed it has at least worn the decent
cloak of the Confucian tradition.</p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> II</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">THE RISE OF NATIONALISM</a></h2>


<p>Of the constituent movements of modern China, the most
important has focused on the personality, principles, and following
of Sun Yat-sen (1867-1925). Now known primarily as
the Nationalist movement, it has at various times emphasized
different aspects of its program. In its simplest and most
fundamental points, the movement has fallen heir to early
patriotism. It has assumed different names: the Society for
the Regeneration of China (1894-1905), or <em>Hsing Chung Hui</em>;
the League of Common Alliance (1905-1912), or <em>T'ung M&ecirc;ng
Hui</em>; the Nationalist Democratic Party or National People's
Party (1912-1914), or Kuomintang; the Chung Hua K&ecirc; Ming
Tang (1914-1920), or Chinese Revolutionary Party; and since
1920, again the <em>Kuomintang</em>. Kuomintang is the combination
of three Chinese words meaning "country" or "realm," "people,"
and "party." The name of the party can be translated in
innumerable ways: nationalist democratic, nationalist popular,
national people's party, etc. The commonest rendering is
"Nationalist," but it is to be remembered that the word "people"
figures in the name. Furthermore, the Chinese version of
patriotism has more cosmopolitan and fewer restrictive connotations
than patriotism ever had in the West.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Nationalism: Patriotic Anti-Manchu Phase</a></em></p>

<p>Even in a world society that knew neither state nor nation the
Chinese felt attached to their homes and their native land,
which led them to repel invaders. They never personified this
loyalty or tried to express it in specific institutions; nor did they
admit outsiders to equality and concede that there was more
of the civilized world outside, thus admitting the existence of
nations. Their attitude rested on sentiment rather than theory.
There was no elaborate bolstering of Chinese racial superiority,
for&mdash;by and large&mdash;all the peoples in China, conquerors or
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="pg 32"> </a>
conquered, seemed racially alike, fused under the pressure of
great social homogeneity.</p>

<p>At the time of the Manchu conquest (about 1644) the Chinese
developed a passionate hatred for the invaders from the northeast.
In entrenching themselves the Manchus committed a
fateful blunder which was to bring momentary strength but
ultimate ruin: they enforced racial segregation in the political,
social, and economic sphere. Legend has it that a Chinese
statesman, forced into Manchu service, suggested this plan and
thus laid the cornerstone for the eventual Chinese liberation.
The Manchus prohibited miscegenation; they established Manchu
garrisons throughout the Empire, keeping their troops from
work (which might have led to intermingling with the Chinese)
and thus ruining them by sloth. A fixed quota of Manchus
was introduced into the government service, irrespective of the
operation of the examination system. In time the Chinese
scholars submitted willingly enough to the alien rule; two of the
Manchu emperors were the most enlightened patrons which
Chinese letters and arts had had in centuries, and the intellectual
opposition dwindled away to a minimum.</p>

<p>Among the populace there was no such general reconciliation.
Deprived for the first time of scholarly leadership, the common
people, peasants and artisans, organized numerous secret societies.
The societies flourished, coming to supersede the government
in whole areas and marking many decades with insurrection
and riot. Scholars fought the secret societies because of their
uncouth rituals, their heterodoxy of ideas, their opposition to
the existing system. The societies answered by building up
political agencies which were able to act on the lower and more
generally understood levels of ideology.</p>

<p>These groups kept patriotism afire. The greatest of their
uprisings, the T'ai-p'ing rebellion of 1849-1865, was put down
with the assistance of the Western Christian states, but it left a
permanent mark on Chinese society. The rebels had shown
that it was possible to wrest the greater part of China from
Manchu rule. They were the first to welcome the invasion of
Christianity, adopting a fantastically modified Christian faith.
They awakened the Chinese to the immediate possibility of a war of
liberation against the outsiders who held the throne of the Chinese
world.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" title="pg 33"> </a></p>

<p>The T'ai-p'ing rebellion showed its strength as a patriotic
movement. It was successful in shaking the established ideology
with a rival compounded of the more vulgar parts of the old,
combined with Christianity. And it indicated the weakest
point of the dynasty&mdash;governmental inadequacy in dealing with
the agrarian problem. The years of formal stability gave China
a much increased population; the same years were years of
political decline which raised the cost of government. A house-cleaning
was in order. The T'ai-p'ing demonstrated the need
for it; the Manchu dynasty refused to yield to the demand.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen was born in 1866 or 1867. An uncle of his had
been one of the rebels. At Sun's parental home the countryside
had known of the T'ai-p'ing rebellion; many in his native village
had participated in it. He was as patriotic as any Chinese could
be in the far south, where the Manchu conquest had penetrated
least deeply, but his patriotism did not differ from the patriotism
of his neighbors until he came to know life outside China. From
the patriotism of the old Chinese realm to the nationalism
required of China in the new Westernized world&mdash;this was a step
to be traversed only by rich personal experience.</p>

<p>Sun took this step as a boy, when he went to Honolulu. He
soon was converted to Christianity, learned English, and became
acquainted with Western life. He was able to see the world in
terms of nations, and he saw that from the Western point of view
China was a large but weak nation. Already committed from
childhood to the revolutionary cause, he was led by his knowledge
of the West to change patriotism into nationalism. When
he returned to China, after studying medicine in Hongkong, he
arrived with the notion of transforming the old world community
into an effective modern nation-state.</p>

<p>He did not seem at first to realize how necessary it was to
dispose of the monarchy. For a while he petitioned the authorities,
trusting that immediate reforms might be effected within
the existing framework, pending an ultimate revolution of
patriots. His success must be measured in terms of what he and
his few fellow workers learned, rather than of what they accomplished.
His technique of revolution was based upon the
established traditions of Chinese history&mdash;the formation of a
small nucleus, the gathering of affiliated groups, the permeation
of a regional bureaucracy when possible, and the launching
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="pg 34"> </a>
of terroristic attacks to shake the apparent stability of the
government.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his work he came into contact with the
secret groups. When he started organizing in earnest, the first
major development was the admittance en bloc of a small secret
society. In an unpublished autobiography Sun wrote: "After
my graduation I practised medicine in Canton and Macao as a
pretext for spreading my revolutionary ideas."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="r14">1</a></sup></p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Nationalism: Revolutionary Modernist Phase</a></em></p>

<p>The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 was the cause of much
disturbance in China and the first major event to shake the belief
of the masses in their own ideology. Fantastic barbarians with
deadly contrivances might harry the coasts and even allow
themselves impertinences with the dynasty, but the situation
became different when a small, inoffensive, ineffectual neighbor
nation took over these same weapons and spoiled the internal
arrangements of the Far Eastern universe. The peripheral
countries could perhaps even demolish the central suzerainty;
this was the <em>mene-tekel</em> of the Empire.</p>

<p>The revolutionary organization of Sun Yat-sen had by now
become definitely modernist, nationalist, and antimonarchical,
instead of merely patriotic and antidynastic. Under the name
of <em>Hsing Chung Hui</em> there was established a confederacy of
secret societies. After a short while the member societies were
liquidated, and a modern revolutionary organization emerged,
advocating overthrow of the Manchus. The intellectual elite
of this group had no part in the ideological control which gripped
the rest of China, in the form of the traditional mandarinate.
As a new elite, with a new ideology, it broke the monopoly of
leadership, the monopoly of thought. The consequences
cannot be exaggerated. It was symptomatic that Sun's own
family became estranged in part and that many members of
the society had to die a civil death before working in the organization.
They left their property to heirs and changed their names,
lest&mdash;under the principle of group responsibility&mdash;terrible
punishments be visited upon their native villages and their
families. Furthermore, an important bloc of participants
consisted of Chinese from overseas.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" title="pg 35"> </a></p>

<p>The Chinese overseas were for the most part men who had been
kidnaped and sold in the coolie trade or who had stealthily
deserted their native regions for adventure and wealth. With
the increased foreign commerce it was possible for many Chinese
to become wealthier outside their own country than within.
But in leaving they left their custom and tradition and met
peoples&mdash;especially Europeans and Americans&mdash;whose way of
life, though utterly different, was effective in the practical,
tangible terms of wealth and security. Chinese in increasing
numbers bettered their condition outside. They did not amass
wealth through family effort, nor did they broaden their learning
through the classics. What they won, they won themselves;
and they learned something for which the Confucian ideology
had no place. When they returned home, they were greeted
with contempt, though also with covert admiration. Those
among them who had gathered knowledge of the West, of modern
methods of business, of European languages, found that in the
eyes of the traditional literati and officials they were lower than
the lowest illiterates.</p>

<p>Such men came in great numbers to the revolutionary party.
Among overseas Chinese merchants, workers, and students, there
developed a group&mdash;possessing power in the form of money and
family connections&mdash;which was determined to overthrow the
existing order and bring China in line with the outside world.
Their effort was idealistic, because the Chinese overseas felt
that the economic and cultural advantages of the West should
be secured for their countrymen at home; it was also realistic,
since they were fighting in the only way they knew for a respectable,
honorable return to their homes. They could not throw
their lives away and admit that their ventures and dangers were
of no profit. They felt that they had acquired something, and
they wanted it recognized. It was Sun Yat-sen who showed
them how they could do it.</p>

<p>In a sense, this feature of the Nationalist movement might be
taken as the pivot of modern Chinese government and politics.
Controlling men through controlling their minds and through
making sure that every possible leader would lead from within
the hierarchy&mdash;these devices of the past had failed. There were
now Chinese to whom the Confucian rules were pleasant and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" title="pg 36"> </a>
homelike but not the real material of modern life. These
Chinese possessed intellectually trained leaders who had nothing
in common with the dominant elite&mdash;who were more interested
in building railroads, improving water supplies, defending China's
frontiers, and modernizing the country than in augmenting the
virtue of mankind.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Nationalism: Republican Phase</a></em></p>

<p>Every year brought the Nationalists increased strength. The
Manchu court yielded a series of constitutional reforms which
by their promises disturbed the minds of those still content with
the old order and by their nonfulfillment raised fresh storms of
resentment against the Manchu rule. The court did not really
seek to master the drift in the thought of the people; it tried to
defeat change rather than direct it.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="r15">2</a></sup> In a few short years before
and after 1900 the Dragon Throne declined from the supreme
office of mankind to an obsolete and picturesque ornament
of a government so weak and disorganized as to render ornament
artificial. While the Empire lost prestige, the Nationalists came
to emphasize the republican part of their program more and more.
As Nationalists, they differed little from the generations of
patriots who had fought the alien rulers of China. As republicans,
they were the Chinese vanguard of modernization. Some
people accepted republican ideas as good in themselves; far
more thought them better than the Manchu rule, especially since
there was no Chinese pretender in sight&mdash;the heir of the Mings,
the last native dynasty, was a pensioner in Peking. A large
number probably thought little about the abstract issue one way
or another but trusted the revolutionary leaders because they
seemed to have a competence consonant with the times.</p>

<p>As the Nationalists advanced, they reorganized their party
mechanism, and formed the T'ung M&ecirc;ng Hui in 1905. At this
time the principles which were later to become the <em>San Min
Chu I</em><sup><a href="#fn16" id="r16">3</a></sup> were given public formulation. The Nationalists began
to feel the necessity of an ideology with which to replace that
of the Confucian monarchy. It had been possible to leave
doubt unsettled so long as they were a small, conspiratorial
group. As soon as they began to secure adherents among the
masses it became necessary to provide their followers with a
common set of ideas. In seeking agreement on fundamentals,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" title="pg 37"> </a>
they found disagreements within the party. Sun Yat-sen's
role began to change from conspiracy to statesmanship. The
future was to show that even a statesman was not enough&mdash;that
a lawgiver, a state founder, was needed.</p>

<p>The T'ung M&ecirc;ng Hui was one of the most effective revolutionary
organizations which the modern world has seen, so far as
achievement of immediate aims was concerned. In a series of
activities which would rouse a mystery-story addict to startled
incredulity, the revolutionaries tried to awaken the populace
by spectacular revolts. They capitalized on the impotence of a
government alien to China, one so ineffectual that it could not
protect the Chinese from the other, newer aliens who had
appeared. They realized that it was hopeless to attack the
monarchy along its entire front, since the old ideological guidance,
although waning, still held the broad masses in inertia. The
revolutionaries accordingly attacked the Empire at its top
level, its most obvious and conspicuous points of strength&mdash;the
military and political headquarters of the viceroyalties and other
significant positions. Knowing that they themselves could not
monopolize the government of China, they looked forward to
attaining a position of leadership among the various groups in
the Chinese society and to keeping that leadership through parliamentary
methods to be established under the Republic. Instead
of regarding the Empire as a set of institutions, they considered
it the mere decoration of the country. They had no reason to
suppose, nor any way of telling, that in destroying the old regime
they destroyed government and all possibility of government
for a long time to come. They consequently tried to set in
motion a snowball revolution&mdash;an initial conspiracy of terror
which would intimidate the Manchus and cause the whole house of
cards to collapse. It was their task only to start the movement,
which could be counted upon to avalanche itself into history.</p>

<p>To the revolutionary group a republican scheme seemed
possible. They felt that in the twentieth century men would
disagree but amicably, and they regarded democracy as a form
of government so excellent that its mere inauguration would
guarantee success. Furthermore, republicanism and democracy
were closely associated with nationalism; how could a nation be
free unless it governed itself in the most direct manner&mdash;through
the votes of its broad majorities?</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_38" title="pg 38"> </a></p>

<p>In failing to provide a stopping point for the revolution
before they started it, the Nationalists were scarcely guilty of
rash action. No human being could have foretold the consequences
of revolt against a civilization. The revolutionaries
were men who had passed through the transition from the old
Confucian ideology to that of the West with relative ease. They
did not realize that what was obvious to them would be a mystery
to the masses and that the political changes contemplated would
rip asunder the very fabric of thought in China. It is evidence
of the simplicity and usefulness of Confucian ideas that&mdash;even
when admitted to be challenged by the new environment&mdash;they
continued to operate without the sanction of intelligence, and
operated well as empty habits.</p>

<p>With the old patriotic forces behind them, and an untested
Utopia ahead, the Nationalists raced the Manchu Empire into
revolution. The story of the revolution is not complex.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="r17">4</a></sup> In
a great part of China the people awoke to find no government.
In the North the imperial officials and princes clamored for the
assistance of a man whom they had once slighted: Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai,
the leader of the modernized armies of the Empire. He
held the fate of China in his hands. But he betrayed the Empire
so that he might betray the Republic; he joined the revolutionaries
and thrust a settlement upon the ruling house. With
his intervention the whole picture of Chinese politics changed.
Y&uuml;an brought troops into the play of power, troops dependent
upon himself, men no longer interested in ideas now that the all-compelling
force of the old way of thought was gone.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Nationalism: Constitutionalist Phase</a></em></p>

<p>The Republic at Nanking enjoyed a brief Utopian existence,
with Sun Yat-sen as its president. The revolutionaries were
independent from October, 1911, to March, 1912, when the
Republic became the instrument of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai. No substantial
power accrued to the legislative.</p>

<p>During their bright heyday of power as a parliamentary
party under the Republic&mdash;which they had founded only to
give it away to the military&mdash;the Nationalists were known as
the <em>Kuomintang</em>. At this time the Chinese name of the party
was significantly translated "Democratic Party." Sun Yat-sen
and the revolutionaries had expected that the Chinese people
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" title="pg 39"> </a>
would accept the new ideology without understanding it and then
would come to understand it very quickly. They could not
hope to replace the old ideology before the revolution, because
the presence of the imperial government made large-scale educational
work impossible. After the establishment of the Republic,
however, they found themselves hamstrung because they had
not inculcated republicanism. It was a vicious circle. The
governmental pattern set up at Nanking was replaced by another
to make room for Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai, who proposed a third, in which
he should have more power, in order that he might create a
fourth government, in which he should be emperor.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="r18">5</a></sup> The
armies of the revolutionaries, such as they were, became absorbed
in the forces of Y&uuml;an. When, in a few months, the Republic
had been won and lost, the Nationalists realized that the revolution
of 1911-1912 was only the first step in their labors. They
experimented with a minor revolution in 1913, and then turned
to other measures for securing a return to constitutional government
and the creation of a republic which should be as firmly
rooted in men's minds as the majestic but irretrievable Confucian
order had been. They had won the revolution by creating doubt
and giving it tangible expression; they lost their revolution
because doubt persisted, swallowed everything, leaving China
in a turmoil beyond all systematic thought.</p>

<p>The first years of the nominal Republic, the beginning of the
new order in China, were marked by a feverish pretense of
changed forms. The outlook which superseded the ancient
ideology was curious. It was a mixture of traditionalist acceptance
of temporary disorder and resignation to a period of transformation
into an unconceived and unproclaimed future. This
outlook gave life no purpose, but it kept men from falling into
complete anarchy. People were willing to accept illegal authorities,
since local administrators had traditionally maintained a
spotty cloak of public order. Modern Chinese were prepared to
pay lip service to a preposterous parliamentary regime but soon
found that it was comfortable to think in terms such as armies,
foreign interference, and money&mdash;thus allowing their thinking
to settle in the large framework of an accepted disorder.</p>

<p>The Nationalists tried to combat this anticonstitutional way of
thought. For six years (1914-1920) they combined conspiratorial
techniques with the role of a legally constituted power
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="pg 40"> </a>
fighting for law. They assumed the name <em>Chinese Revolutionary
Party</em> until they discovered that they could secure no ideological
foothold upon which to base the order they proposed. Some of
them went so far as to become anarchists, favoring a continuance
of disorder until the world joined China in collapse. Others
followed an unrealistic legalism; they held to the paper constitution,
to the text of the president's oath of allegiance to the
constitution, to the election laws, thinking that the magic of
ink would conjure up a government. Sun Yat-sen, and the body
of his followers with him, attempted to chart a middle course;
in 1917 there was created a "lawful" administration in the South.
With extraordinary good fortune the Republic might have
succeeded, but the war in Europe, the Japanese interventions,
and other adverse circumstances prevented this.</p>

<p>The Nationalists changed the name of their party back to
<em>Kuomintang</em> after 1920 but did not discontinue their reformist
policies until about two years later. Sun Yat-sen had spent
years in study and propaganda; eventually his program became
an ideology. No sharp line can be drawn between the two. In
some respects the very first programs of the revolutionaries were
ideological, in that they presupposed a change in man's outlook
which would accommodate republican government. On the
other hand, programmatic proposals may be distinguished from
ideological theses by the fact that programs refer to things which
should be done and ideologies to things in which men should
believe in order to do anything at all. A program which is
rooted in no ideology is one lacking context; unless a program
refers to some accepted scheme of thought it is words in a vacuum.
Similarly, an ideology without programs to put it into men's
minds, to persuade men to believe in it and give it effect, is an
airy prettiness for philosophers. The Nationalists had stood
on the foundations of Confucian common sense and proposed a
republic; they had destroyed the organization which made that
common sense seem real and had cut the ground from under
their own feet. They could not distinguish values because
their critical attitude enveloped all moral notions or made them
isolated points without coherent significance. The Nationalists
themselves fell prey to day-dreaming when they appealed to
worthless paper for their right to govern. The epoch is significant
in the history of the movement in that it taught the Nationalists
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_41" title="pg 41"> </a>
that men would not fight unless there was something to fight for
and that there was nothing to fight for until men could find
desirable elements embedded in some larger scheme of life.
Politics had to have an end and an environment; without either
it was a series of monologues in the wilderness, the soliloquies
of logicians.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen during this time wrote the drafts of monumental
treatises which were to relate the general body of his doctrines
to the background of fact and thought from which they had
emerged. He never finished them, but meanwhile he and his
followers realized that if they were to have a grip over government
they must grasp power within the brains of men. The revolutionary
reformists had to supply some better medium of persuasion
than the frivolity of military cynicism or the impudence
of shadow government. They had to abandon legalism and
bring forth an ideology capable of serving as the new foundation
for a just and effective system of government in China. If
their original importance was that of an effective counter-elite
springing up in the intellectual borderlands between the Western
and Chinese ideologies, their second period of significance
begins with their realization that a new framework of thought
would have to be set up before any of their programs could be
effectuated.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Political Doctrines of Sun Yat-sen</a></em></p>

<p>The ideology which the Nationalists were to teach was one
which had lain dormant in the party for more than thirty years.
It was the invention of Sun Yat-sen&mdash;his reinterpretation of
Confucianism to suit the modern world. He did not settle
down with books before him, pen in hand and notebooks all
about, to formulate a Utopia; nor did he approach the subject
as a historian, seeking scientific causes for the emotions and
loyalties of men. He came to the subject as a political leader,
modifying the given background only so far as was necessary.
His doctrines grew with his personal growth and the development
of his movement. They are scattered among a variety of
writings and utterances, and are contradictory in many points
although remarkably consistent as a whole.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen asked himself: What is China? China is a race,
he said, a race which was once great and which held benevolent
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" title="pg 42"> </a>
world leadership in the world it knew. It has declined because
it has fallen upon evil days, under the rule of outsiders, barbarians,
and has failed to develop in ways which the West
discovered. This race should be a nation in the modern world;
a great, powerful, united, effective nation in a world of nations.
It should fight for its right of self-rule and should support justice
in the international community. In order to achieve greatness,
the Chinese will have to turn their nation into an effective state
and add the devices of law to the devices of social control through
ideology. They should rethink their ideology, keeping the old
ethical philosophy and the old social knowledge (the technique
of control through thought, as in Confucianism) but adding
Western technics. They should then strive to make their
nation the leader in progress toward world peace and eventual
cosmopolitanism. China should turn to nationalism for the
time&mdash;decades or centuries&mdash;that remained for the travail of
nations, but the Chinese should never forget the world society
whence they came. This is the first of Sun's three principles,
<em>nationalism</em>.</p>

<p>The second principle referred to the problem of leadership and
the organization of government. Obviously, the Chinese could
not return to monarchy in the modern world. In the first place,
it would not be modern; Sun lived at a time when the democratic
tide was sweeping to its high point and when the world triumph
of democracy seemed a foregone conclusion. Secondly, Sun
thought it disloyal to China's past for the Chinese to evade the
responsibility of democracy, as it was implicit in their most
ancient traditions and thus an obligation laid upon them by
their first great leaders. Thirdly, he thought that good administration
was to be derived from democracy more readily than from
any other system. Fourthly, because democracy was a modernizing
force, it should be introduced; the people, participating in
progress, would themselves become progressive. Fifthly and
most necessarily, democracy was simply the self-control of a
nation. If the nation was to be created and made free through
nationalism it had to become democratic, since there was no
other way for a whole people to express and rule itself. But
the Chinese needed specific devices<sup><a href="#fn19" id="r19">6</a></sup> in order to assure that the
old system of selecting an intellectual leadership would not be
compromised or destroyed by democracy. They should see to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_43" title="pg 43"> </a>
it that democracy did not become mob rule. The Chinese people
should become self-indoctrinating and thus maintain ideological
control along with political. But the Chinese should accommodate
the concept of the state in their thinking, since the concentration
of power in Western states made it necessary that
there be in China an equivalent social device for canalizing and
concentrating power, in order to meet Western and Japanese
attacks. The egalitarian features of democracy should be congenial
to the democracy of customs and manners which was
indigenous to old China. This was the second principle,
<em>democracy</em>.</p>

<p>The third principle was the restatement in modern political
terms of the cardinal economic principles of the past, together
with an infusion of newly invented doctrines. It protected the
livelihood of the people, and may be summed up in a single
sentence: No government deserves to exist unless it assures its
people of the maximum of material welfare possible under
prevailing physical conditions. Government was of no use if
the people perished. The state was nothing if its substance was
lost. Political leadership should aim at constant improvement of
economic conditions, spread economic benefits, and make the
nation healthy. In doing so it was not to be bound by any
creed of capitalism or communism but was to experiment and
seek the most efficient measures for the benefit of the whole
community. This last principle involved the <em>life</em> of the nation,
as nationalism did its <em>birth</em> and democracy its <em>freedom</em>. It was
an ethical doctrine rather than a schematic principle, and cannot
be properly translated. It should best be left in the Chinese,
and expressed by two words which mean "people" and "generation":
<em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em>.</p>

<p>This ideology gave the Nationalists a faith to propagate. It
was designed to achieve the revision of the old Confucian
ideology; experience and the accepted ideology would supply
this new skeleton with flesh. It differed radically from the
Marxian doctrine in that it was traditionalistic and nationalistic;
it resembled the Marxian doctrine in that it sought to create a
whole new intellectual civilization before turning to the question
of government.</p>

<p>The new ideology had to make headway against other propagandas,
the partially adequate ways of thought which had
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_44" title="pg 44"> </a>
grown up since the establishment of the Republic. It had to
restore life to the vast corpse of Confucianism, and soon after
its first general promulgation (1924) had to fight its temporary
ally&mdash;communism&mdash;for power over Chinese minds.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Opportunist Movements and their Anticonstitutional Effects</a></em></p>

<p>The field which the Nationalists invaded to propagate their
doctrines was already occupied. The slow evaporation of the
Confucian moral, intellectual, and social system had given rise to
various movements which, for lack of a better term, may be
called <em>half-ideological</em>. These movements made no pretense of
presenting a new order sufficient for Chinese thought and belief,
but&mdash;in the opinion of those constituting them&mdash;they did
afford an adequate frame of reference for immediate action.
Some of the half-ideologies were: (1) military feudalism, (2)
provincial <em>tuch&uuml;nism</em> (3) China-wide militarism, (4) bureaucratism,
and (5) capitalism. Although none of them succeeded in
indoctrinating broad masses of the population, yet each was
effective in a negative way. Each obstructed the development
of any coherent system of social and political life. Each was
anticonstitutional, since it proposed to constitute a scheme
narrowly pragmatic or unattainable in fact.</p>

<p>The presence of these movements gave China an appearance
of considerable freedom in the earlier years of the Republican
era. Diversity of opinion based upon a fundamental concord in
outlook&mdash;diversity circumscribed by one cohesive ideology&mdash;may
be most wholesome in social and political life. When diversity
penetrates so deep as to include all major aspects of human
existence, it becomes insupportable, a hindrance and not a
stimulant to action. When policy is predetermined by tradition,
thought is easy, action relatively more difficult; when there is
discord even on fundamentals, thought is difficult, action easy.
Almost any scheme mitigating the evils of discord will be assured
a hearing; if the world cannot be rationalized, the individual
will be.</p>

<p>Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai inaugurated, in his efforts to control China
through military means, a way of thought which might be characterized
as military feudalism of the twentieth century variety, an
order based upon contract between commander and soldier, upon
the payment of wages by the former and the performance of any
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_45" title="pg 45"> </a>
task by the latter. This militarism never flowered in literature,
never developed a political theory, never achieved governmental
form. Even Y&uuml;an felt its inadequacy as a state philosophy,
and by his attempt to establish a modern monarchy ruined
what chances he might have had for anticipating Mussolini with
a Fascist movement. As it was, the movement of military
thought was derived from the facts rather than propagated to
excuse the facts. The militarists themselves abandoned it
whenever they found substitutes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the movement for a military ideology was at
times the prevailing mode of thought among the men who held
power in China. They were able to gain perspective on their own
behavior by reference to the old traditions, regarding themselves
as upright magistrates in a time of chaos. For working purposes
they could claim from their subordinates and superiors a vague
constitutionalism limited to army circles. Amid the cowardice,
betrayal, and corruption in the military dictatorships, tendencies
occasionally appeared leading toward an effective military spirit.
Certain kinds of betrayal or cruelty were beyond the limits of
good soldiering, but not many.</p>

<p>A more effective explanation for the condition of the armies
in China from 1916 to about 1931 may be found in <em>tuch&uuml;nism</em>.
A <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> was a military commandant ruling an area ranging from
a few districts to a number of provinces.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="r20">7</a></sup> The imperial regime
maintained a military counterpart to the provincial governor.
After the Republican Revolution provinces tended to become
separate and autonomous under military leaders. The military
man, who was prone to apologize for his position by admitting
that he was not developing a permanent establishment, who
held his troops together by a modern feudalism, could also
rationalize his role by presenting himself to his province as a
good son, by stressing the wickedness and strangeness of the
soldiers in other provinces, and by suggesting the thought of
federalism. The scheme was not convincing or edifying, but it
could become temporarily popular. A great part of the news
from China is still written in terms of <em>tuch&uuml;nism</em>&mdash;since it is a
simple pattern and requires no explanation involving Chinese
peculiarities. Satrapies have become tyrannies in all ages.
At the very best the <em>tuch&uuml;nist</em> movement could not have served
well as the constituent force of a new China. It would necessarily
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_46" title="pg 46"> </a>
have ended in one-man government, almost unthinkable
with modern Chinese conditions; or it would have implied a
military federalism which is scarcely a solution to the problem
of unity.</p>

<p>Military cliques at times had China-wide proportions, but
despite the proclamations which were occasionally issued, there
was no effective single movement for a general military regime.
Such movements as there were developed within the framework
of the shadow Republic. Moreover, the shifting alignments of
Chinese wars within the nominal organization of the Republic
were so confused as to make almost anything but order seem possible.
Yet many Chinese thought in terms of a "realism"
compounded of slogans and military exigencies.</p>

<p>If movements for military feudalism, provincial <em>tuch&uuml;nism</em>,
and (most nebulous of all) China-wide militarism failed to provide
more than an explanation of immediate fact, there were counterparts
in the civilian administration aspiring to political autonomy
for particular cliques. Ministries tended at times to develop a
spirit of independence. Finance was too close to the military,
but the revenue collection services (with a large European and
Japanese personnel) and the postal services behaved as <em>imperia
in imperio</em>. The foreign office functioned frequently without
effective superiors. Working without pay a great part of the
time, in a period which offered no near solution for its disastrous
troubles, bureaucrats saw in the increase of bureaucracy a possible
inauguration of order. The ministries did function in a
way, despite the chaos about them. They might have evolved
a new bureaucratism to steal the <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>' power. Their spirit
was helpful in particular and damaging in general, since it was
bound to sabotage any government which might come to power.
A few years of insecurity may weld a bureaucracy together more
closely than would decades of spoils; this was the case between
1916 and 1928. Bureaucratism demonstrates the limitations of
opportunist ideology as a foundation for government.</p>

<p>Capitalism flourished wherever economic conditions made it
possible; such economic conditions did not last very long under
the jurisdiction of the military. In treaty ports<sup><a href="#fn21" id="r21">8</a></sup> the Chinese
capitalists prospered, secure under governments which were
international in effect, Chinese only in legal fiction. There
Chinese soon amassed enough capital to compete with economic
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" title="pg 47"> </a>
institutions erected by foreigners, and exercised an important
indirect influence on the growth of Chinese government. Capitalism
helped to thwart a peasant-labor alliance in China, for
although the capitalists were an insignificant minority without
country-wide influence, its form of control was mobile. No
army, no surge of popular resentment, no propaganda, no conspirator
can travel as fast as a telegraphic money order. The
ideology of capitalism was content in China to remain subordinate
as long as the political and legal conditions were
favorable to it. Capitalist groups supported any sort of strong
government which might protect property and increase opportunities
for investment.</p>

<p>Among the most pitiful of the movements for the construction
of a general agreement in China were the proalien movements.
They were pitiful because they represented a prostitution of
thought by men conscious of the nature of their action. The
Anfu Party flourished in the first decade after the death of Y&uuml;an
in 1916; together with its militarism and its meaningless "realism"
it was pro-Japanese. The present "government" in North
China<sup><a href="#fn22" id="r22">9</a></sup> is another such movement. Manchoukuo bases little of
her official ideology on such a dangerous outlook and prefers to
propagate a Confucianist traditionalism in so far as she propagates
anything. Pro-Japanese action may express a discontent
with the competence of the Chinese for self-government, but more
forcefully it relates to theories of Pan-Asianism or Pan-Mongolism.</p>

<p>The opportunist movements&mdash;militarism, <em>tuch&uuml;nism</em>, military
federalism, bureaucratic separatism, capitalism, and political
puppetry&mdash;served to confuse the basic alternatives. Because
they reflected a narrow and accidental scheme of power rather
than long-range transformation, they possessed a specious realism
which obfuscated real issues. They distracted attention without
rewarding it and polarized opinion around conflicts which were
beyond settlement. There is no possibility of agreement between
men who think one another deluded in regard to fundamentals.
Disorder in China was the more violent because of these different
explanations. They delayed the creation of a framework in
which men could find a common reasonableness, an ideology
sufficient to rationalize all interests and to sublimate all
frustrations.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="pg 48"> </a></p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Christianity as a Political Force</a></em></p>

<p>Ever since the establishment of American and British Protestant
missions in the nineteenth century, Christianity has been a
conditioning force for a democratic ideology in Asia.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="r23">10</a></sup> The
Protestants were among the first to make a breach in the stronghold
of Confucianism; they secured international action to assist
them. Their role was that of counter-ideologues whose position
was guaranteed by treaty (British Treaty of Tientsin, 1858;
American Treaty of Tientsin, 1858). They possessed the
power, under the legal sanction of the Chinese government, to
preach against the moral foundations upon which that government
rested. A missionary wrote in 1887:</p>

<blockquote><p>The foremost opposition to the introduction of Christianity comes
from those who esteem themselves the followers of Confucius. They
assent to our views about the "emptiness" of Buddhism, the deceptions
of Taoism, the character of the priesthood, the mud and stone of the
images, but when we gently allude to ancestral idolatry, the worship
of heaven and earth, and the sacrifices of the mandarins, they are
offended. Also, the Confucianists do the thinking for the people; they
have the minds, the books, the schools, and the offices. Without a
long residence in the country it is hard to imagine the influence of a
penniless scholar in his neighbourhood, and the mental control he exercises
over the minds of the peasantry. More than this, the graduates
at the government examinations form a clique or "ring," and their voice
is the unwritten law of China, their authority above that of His Excellency
the Governor. The lamented Carstairs Douglas said at the
Shanghai Missionary Conference of 1877, "Confucianism is the citadel;
take it, and the war is ended."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="r24">11</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>But for the presence of Christianity, a Chinese counter-elite
with sufficient moral self-assurance and intellectual ability to
attack the traditional institutions of the Empire might not have
developed. Sun Yat-sen was a Christian, although in his case
Christianity has been less of a modernizing force compared with
the influence of his actual experience abroad. Large numbers
of the reformist and republican leaders were Christian, some of
them with missionary or Y. M. C. A. connections. These men
were not bound by the moral tenets of Confucianism; those
among them who had mission school educations had little in
common with the long intellectual tradition of the Chinese. For
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" title="pg 49"> </a>
a while Christianity spelled Westernization and provided an
avenue of self-advancement hitherto unprecedented in China&mdash;one
outside the archaic scheme of things.</p>

<p>With the coming of the Republic, Christian ethics appeared
to have an open field. The emphasis which Christianity places
upon the value of individual human life was favorable to the
emergence of modern republican institutions. Even Y&uuml;an
Shih-k'ai is said to have acknowledged the influence of Christianity
in this respect; he is reported to have said, in an interview
with a leading missionary educator, "You missionaries are responsible
for this revolution. Now you must see us through."<sup><a href="#fn25" id="r25">12</a></sup>
The implication of doctrines of human brotherhood is obvious,
despite the fact that such doctrines&mdash;in less forceful and spiritual
form&mdash;were a familiar feature of certain Chinese philosophies.</p>

<p>In its more direct effects Christianity demonstrated a variety
of new points to the Chinese. The intervention of the missionaries
was not only moral; it was scientific, and the early mission
leaders brought Western engineering and industrial methods
with them. They published the first journal in Chinese to give
regular accounts of practical mechanics. As the missions themselves
developed, the physical presence of the Protestant missionaries
and of Western ways of life&mdash;to which they adhered in
contrast with the Catholics&mdash;became strong informational
influences. Later the rise of churches and of Christian establishments
gave the Chinese experience in the Western methods of
social and business organization.</p>

<p>In practical administration the Christian impact has been
striking. American missionaries were influential in developing
popular education in China. They have led the way in
public health. They have organized model orphanages and
have assailed infanticide, footbinding, and concubinage. They
have been the public opinion of the Western world, right on the
spot, and have introduced the Chinese to a great many of the
best features of Western life. Finally, the Christians have
embellished and justified Western imperialism in China. The
mission enterprises have been among the most expensive and
elaborate philanthropic agencies ever set up by one state for the
benefit of another. The advance of the West has been saved
from seeming unrelieved imperialism. The West has taken,
but it has also returned. Christianity has been the companion
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" title="pg 50"> </a>
and the antagonist of Western exploitation in the East; it has
suffered and benefited because of this position.</p>

<p>The total contribution of Christianity to Chinese politics
cannot be assessed. The ways of Christian influence are frequently
pervasive and incalculable. In the headquarters of
the Chinese Red Army, Chinese Communist leaders have quietly
gone away to pray. The Christians have breached the Confucian
citadel and have weakened the ideological foundations of government.
They have also torn the web of Chinese popular superstition
and afforded a foothold for religion in a truer sense.
There has been no genuine Christian party, no real Christian
army, no government avowedly Christian in policy. Nevertheless,
the first president of the Republic was a Christian, as was
the outstanding founder of the National Government at Nanking,
Chiang K'ai-shek. The Protestant Church counts among its
members a large number of the highest government personnel;
no other religion plays as active a part. Christianity, then, has
been an indirect force, not a program or an immediate political
challenge.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Nationalism: Social-revolutionary Phase</a></em></p>

<p>In 1912 the Nationalists had won their revolution, which was
political in nature, but they found in the ensuing years that
mere change in the form of government would not of itself bring
about the needed regeneration of Chinese society. By 1922
Sun Yat-sen and his followers possessed a well-defined ideology
and a definite new revolutionary program but they had neither
a way of propagating the ideology nor a method of realizing the
program. Sun himself thought in political and economic rather
than agitational terms. He sought loans from abroad and
schemed for power in the turbulent military politics of the time.
His slogan was still that of the Confucians: "Hold office in order
to teach." The Nationalists intended to gain a political rostrum
from which to expound their teachings, since they no longer hoped
to rule effectively without converting the masses to their way of
thought. They had not yet realized that conversion scarcely
required governing and that&mdash;given the appropriate technique&mdash;they
might agitate more successfully as an opposition than as a
government.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" title="pg 51"> </a></p>

<p>The means of systematically winning men's minds&mdash;wholesale
and high-speed agitation&mdash;did not occur to the Nationalists
because the Bolshevist revolution was the only successful demonstration
of such methods, and Russia was not yet understood.
China was just reaching that phase of revolution which the
Communists had already traversed in Russia. Without the
benefit of Russian advice, the Kuomintang might have become a
political sect with long-range plans. Fortunately for their
cause, the Kuomintang leaders were willing to learn and the
Russians willing to teach. Mere physical contact served to
inaugurate the process.</p>

<p>Contact was not afforded by way of the Communist Party
of China, a small and largely academic group which developed
after 1920, but through direct correspondence and negotiation
between Sun Yat-sen and Moscow. Sun had communicated
with persons of influence all over the world, trying to build up
interest in the future of a united and powerful China. He had
conceived a plan for the international development of China
which envisaged the extension of Allied war budgets for one year
after the war, and the lending of vast sums for the modernization
of China. He believed that his project would appeal to imperialism
and at the same time would serve to create in China a modern
state-socialist industrialism. China would thereby become a
customer for all the capitalist nations of the world and alleviate
the depression which was bound to follow the war. Correspondence
about other projects for ideological and political reconstruction
elicited more replies from Russia than from anywhere
else. Sun was not doctrinaire in the furtherance of immediate
projects. He was willing to accept help from the Russians,
just as he would have accepted help from the imperialist nations
had they been prepared to risk their money. From 1920 onward
he was in touch with the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>In December, 1922, and January, 1923, the decisive turning
point was reached. Adolf Joffe, the Soviet representative
in China, had come to Shanghai and conferred with Sun Yat-sen.
These two found that there were terms on which they could
cooperate. The Communist ideology and that of the Nationalists
coincided in their general opposition to imperialism. Resistance
to the treaties which bound China<sup><a href="#fn26" id="r26">13</a></sup> became more and more
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" title="pg 52"> </a>
apparent to Sun as a necessity for further revolutionary progress.
He had met polite regret or open ridicule in his solicitation of
help for China from the imperialist powers, and his invitation to
Western capital had not been taken seriously. The Communists
seemed to have adequate idealistic and practical motives for
joining the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Communists, moreover, conceded a point which they had
not conceded to any other country up to that time. They
willingly assumed a secondary position, agreed that the communist
order of things was not suited to China, and in effect
guaranteed their practical assistance to the Nationalists without
demanding, as the price, the acceptance of Marxism. Sun and
Joffe gave out a joint memorandum which made the issue perfectly
plain. It was to be the constitutional compact between
the Nationalists and the Communists for the period of their
collaboration. The most significant paragraph read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen holds that the communistic order, or even the Soviet
system, cannot actually be introduced into China because there do not
exist the conditions for the successful establishment of either communism
or Sovietism. This view is entirely shared by Mr. Joffe, who is further
of the opinion that China's paramount and most pressing problem is to
achieve national unification and attain full national independence; and
regarding this great task he has assured Dr. Sun Yat-sen that China
has the warmest sympathy of the Russian people and can count on the
support of Russia.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="r27">14</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>In the autumn of 1923 Chiang K'ai-shek was sent by Sun to
Russia to study the Soviet military system. This was the first
step in the formation of a non-mercenary Nationalist army.
About the same time Michael Borodin arrived in Canton, where
Sun had come to power for the third time. The ensuing period
was marked by an intensive reorganization of the Nationalist
Party and of its technique of revolution, to the end that it might
become a movement depending upon mass conversion, not upon
mass apathy, for power. The military mission was followed by
other and more important grants of aid. The Bolsheviks not
only trained Chinese sent to Russia but also supplied military
instructors who reorganized the Nationalist forces on the spot.<sup><a href="#fn28" id="r28">15</a></sup></p>

<p>The assistance rendered by the Soviets in the application of
tested propaganda methods to a revolutionary situation resulted
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" title="pg 53"> </a>
in vast changes. The Russians found that approximately the
same devices could be used in China as in Russia without affecting
the fundamentals of Nationalist philosophy. Integration and
regularization of the party machinery, formulation of immediate
programs to bring large groups into the Nationalist fold,
development of large-scale propaganda techniques, and other
improvements designed to enlarge and speed up the Nationalist
advance were effected within the Kuomintang.</p>

<p>Throughout, Sun Yat-sen worked in close collaboration with
Borodin. The details of Nationalist party reforms and of
Nationalist participation in local politics are now part of the
history of the modern Far East. These details, while significant,
tend to blur the cardinal change: the transformation of the
Nationalist party from a revolutionary elite with long-range
effectiveness into a mass organization designed for propaganda
and immediate general measures. The Russian Communists
made it possible for the Kuomintang to perform in weeks what
had been planned for the decades, or at least to reach the equivalent
of the contemplated performance.</p>

<p>A new era had begun. At first the Nationalists had proposed
to develop a parliamentary government which would gradually
foster a modernized ideology, and to govern China well in the
meanwhile; when this hope vanished with the rise of Y&uuml;an
Shih-k'ai's military power, in 1913, they had to reroute the
revolution. Had they relied upon the experience of the liberal
nations, they might have resigned themselves to a policy of
gradualism. The Communist process of conversion was different
from the Confucian. The Confucians had gradually built up a
body of the most public-spirited men and permeated the ruling
intellectual class with Confucian ideas. Their slow process of
persuasion triumphed with the elevation of their main texts
to the status of bibles in China and with their monopoly of
advanced education. The Communists proposed to take a few
simple, obvious issues, to present them dramatically, to win
as many people as possible to the support of immediate policies
and to reach power through such support. Once political and
military authority had been established, they expected to go
further in the "education" of the masses of the people.</p>

<p>To obtain tangible results quickly the Nationalists had to make
extensive promises. On the advice of the Communists, they led
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_54" title="pg 54"> </a>
vigorous anti-imperialist movements which embittered both
Chinese and foreigners and provided the whole country with
issues more real than the personalities of war lords or the machinations
of cliques. Communist-trained propagandists took the
reforms which the Nationalists had proposed among themselves
and carried them into the people. Sun's principle of <em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em>
appeared in practical programs as an immediate call for socio-economic
revolution. Mass organizations grew, swelling their
ranks by promises to all subordinate economic groups. These
organizations were bound to cause difficulty as soon as it became
apparent that the Nationalist-Communist promises could
not be realized immediately and in full.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Communists maintained their separate
party organization within the Kuomintang. The Russians
found China a fertile field for conversion, and while they assisted
the Nationalists they fostered the growth of a Chinese Communist
Party. From an academic group which meant nothing
in 1921, the Communist Party grew in 1925-1926 to comprise the
radical vanguard of the revolution. The Communists assumed
the vanguard position because they were less bound by loyalty
to the existing groups in Chinese society than were the Nationalists.
The working alliance, in which the Nationalists received
Communist help in money, technical political services, and arms,
made the seizure of political power a reality. Sun Yat-sen died
in March, 1925, before the great surge of the revolution came,
but in 1926 and 1927 the Nationalist-Communist forces proceeded
north, brushing the militarists aside as they went. The combination
of a patriotic, foreign-trained, professionalized army, a
powerful agitation department, and a party organization able to
govern after conquest, came to prevail everywhere. Half of
China was now under Kuomintang dominion, which operated
through a council form of government.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="r29">16</a></sup> Then came the
schism. Conflict was inevitable between Communists and
Nationalists when the Communists proved unwilling to look
forward to the establishment of a republic according to Sun's
principles, pushing on with the revolution as soon as the Nationalists
slowed down or stopped.</p>

<p>Communist training helped the Nationalists to power, but
under circumstances which made necessary either the institution
of terror or the partial inhibition of the Nationalist programs.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_55" title="pg 55"> </a>
The Nationalists had promised almost anything to almost
everyone in order to secure power; this was a part of the propaganda
methods which Communists taught. After seizing power
in 1926-1927 the Nationalists could resort only to military dictatorship
and party terrorism in order to achieve the fulfillment
of their extravagant promises. But the Nationalists were
Chinese, and as such cherished the old notions of moderation and
humanity in government. They were not the master of any
legalism or dialectic which would justify the slaughter of millions
for the good of a system. Millions have died in China, but
the Chinese never acknowledged the massacre. They could not
face the program of class war which their promises inevitably
implied. The Communists kept pressing forward, now giving
pledges in their own name and in the name of the Nationalists,
redeemable only by class warfare or involving the discredit of
the Nationalists. The situation came to a head when the Communists
began taking independent action. Indiscreet Communists
informed Nationalist leaders that the Kuomintang was
to be discarded so that the revolution could continue&mdash;along
Communist lines. The breaks, first with the Kuomintang Right
and then with the Kuomintang Left, occurred in 1927. The
Russians went back to Russia. The Chinese Communists faced
their future alone.</p>

<p>The Canton-Moscow Entente&mdash;as the Nationalist-Communist
coalition has been called&mdash;changed the Nationalist movement
profoundly in 1923-1927. It found the movement a small elite
of opposition and left it a swollen party with a government and
an army under its control, a vast schedule of promises to fulfill,
a second revolution to vindicate.<sup><a href="#fn30" id="r30">17</a></sup></p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> III</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">BATTLING CREEDS</a></h2>


<p>The right-wing Nationalists, establishing the National Government
of China at Nanking in 1927, found themselves in the position
of revolutionaries sitting at roll-top desks. After more than
forty years of criticism and opposition, the movement had
assumed the responsibilities of government. In breaking with
the Communists the Nationalists lost the doctrinal edge of the
extreme Left; thenceforth there were to be groups more radical
than themselves. This disheartened some of the revolutionaries,
who either lost interest in politics or continued revolutionary
opposition to the regime their colleagues had formed.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Nationalism: Governing Phase</a></em></p>

<p>The Kuomintang was confronted with the issues of national
unification, development toward democracy, and realization of
the economic reforms and programs postulated by Sun's principle,
of <em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em>. The instrument for their task was a brand-new
form of government, fresh from the pages of Sun Yat-sen,
which at its birth was beset with difficult military, administrative,
economic, and diplomatic problems. But the Nationalists
had one particular advantage which they shared only with the
Communists&mdash;that of possessing a well-integrated ideology. It
was possible for them to couch intra-Party struggles in a reasonably
consistent set of terms. Even when respect for one of
Sun Yat-sen's theories had been reduced to mere lip service
another from the same source took its place. The intellectual
outlook inherited from the humanistic political training of Confucianism
kept the Chinese from a dogmatic political pseudo-theology,
while the wide circulation of Sun's principles provided
a moral and programmatic foundation for governmental routine.</p>

<p>The break with the Communists and the development of a Red
military problem were continuing forces driving the Nationalists
to the Right, where opportunists and reactionaries of all categories
welcomed them. They were also drawn to the Left&mdash;by
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" title="pg 58"> </a>
the social revolution which had carried them to power and by the
need of agrarian and labor reform. Central to the very continuance
of the government, however, was the military power of
the Nationalist armies led by Chiang K'ai-shek. Without the
armed force to implement their decisions the Nationalists would
have been compelled to let their endeavors subside into subterranean
defeat. To the considerations of Right, Left, and
armed force were added responsibilities incident to government.
The Kuomintang in its governing phase, therefore, plotted its
course with reference to three points: doctrinal consistency,
military necessity, governmental responsibility.<sup><a href="#fn31" id="r31">1</a></sup> As an ideologically
constituent movement, how did Nationalism use its
power?</p>

<p>The Nationalists in power had to find their way through class
alignments, inert and meaningless oppositions, the rancor of the
Left, the contempt of the established monarchist Right. Personalities
in conflict, cliques forming and disbanding, factions
denied overt expression&mdash;these lay behind the pressure politics of
the intra-Party contest for the control of policy conducted on a
thin and novel constitutional plane. The written formulas
guiding the struggle for power were supplemented by the bodies
of unwritten practice which had developed in the years of the
Republic. There were appropriate forms for extraconstitutional
action, just as for constitutional. It was the outstanding contribution
of the Kuomintang to modern Chinese government that
it kept its internal conflicts within its own constitutional framework,
and did so more successfully than any other movement in
modern China.</p>

<p>The meandering and difficult course of Kuomintang policy
flowed within the valley rather than the river bed of Sun Yat-sen's
doctrine. The planning power of Sun's intellect bound the
movement long after his death. In his plans for the regeneration
of China are to be found the ideal requirements for the growth of
modern government under the tutelage of a patriotic elite of
overseas men, revolutionary veterans, and scholars. The Nanking
government of the Kuomintang had to meet all the problems
of government while keeping within the broad boundaries of
Sun's demands. The movement as a whole, however, displayed
certain broad shifts which are readily traceable.<sup><a href="#fn32" id="r32">2</a></sup> Sun Yat-sen
envisaged the establishment of authentic democracy by a course
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" title="pg 59"> </a>
of action including three steps: (1) the military period, in which
the movement should acquire power over the nation through the
use of force; (2) the period of tutelage, in which the members of
the movement should exercise a benevolent party dictatorship
over the nation, while training the populace for democracy; (3)
the period of constitutional democracy, in which the people
should exercise actual self-government.</p>

<p>Shortly after its establishment, the National Government
announced the ending of the period of military conquest and the
opening of the period of tutelage, which was set for 1930-1935.
The Japanese invasions caused the establishment of constitutional
government to be postponed indefinitely, and it is to be
feared that even if constitutional government were installed it
would fall far short of Sun's programs, which called for truly
effective training in the arts of democracy before Chinese government
could be entrusted to the broad masses of the electorate.
In the meantime, the arbitrariness, the political composition, and
the outlook of the transitional Party dictatorship became subjects
of hot controversy among the Kuomintang leaders.</p>

<p>The Party dictatorship demanded a rigor of discipline and a
deflation of revolutionary enthusiasm which soon drove the
militant Left out of the Kuomintang. Even Sun Yat-sen's
brilliant young second wife remained outside the Party&mdash;a
permanent and indefatigable opposition. Within the Party personalities
came to dominate&mdash;Hu Han-min, the chief Rightist
disciple and interpreter of Sun Yat-sen; Chiang K'ai-shek, Sun's
outstanding military protege; and Wang Ch'ing-wei, the chief
Leftist disciple of the Leader. There were also Sun Fo (Sun K'&ecirc;),
the only son of Sun Yat-sen, and other ranking Party members
whose opinions ranged from philosophic anarchism (as in the
case of Wu Chih-hui) to a progressive business outlook not unlike
Mr. Hoover's (as in the instance of T. V. Soong).</p>

<p>The National Government settled down with Chiang and Hu
Han-min (military and Right) holding the leadership, which
Wang Ch'ing-wei decried as reactionary. In 1931 Chiang
ousted Hu, in the course of a conflict over a proposed American
silver loan and over constitutional questions. Shortly thereafter
Wang Ch'ing-wei assumed a place in the government, after participating
in an unsuccessful armed rebellion (the "Nationalist
Government" in Peking, 1930-1931).</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_60" title="pg 60"> </a></p>

<p>This might seem to indicate a swing from the Right to the Left
within the Party. Actually it was indicative of the growing
practicality of the Nationalist movement and its preoccupation
with problems of installing the form of government planned by
Sun.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="r33">3</a></sup> With the passage of time, the Nationalists adopted three
main lines of endeavor: (1) the suppression of the Communists
at all cost, even that of temporary nonresistance to Japan; (2)
the tendency to abandon revolutionary fervor for administrative
zeal, and to become governmental in spirit as well as form&mdash;a
tendency illustrated most notably in the promotion of industry
under H. H. Kung, railways under Sun Fo, and finance under
T. V. Soong; (3) a policy of emphasizing military power, which
meant the rise to effective personal leadership of Chiang K'ai-shek.
The development of a United Front policy in 1937 and
the war with Japan led to the reversal of the first two policies and
an enormous emphasis on the third. The Nationalists again
turned to patriotism on the mass level rather than government
action in a patriotically bureaucratic sphere. This latter policy,
although it may seem strangely nonrevolutionary, was actually
a part of Sun's programs to which the Nationalists were bound.</p>

<p>The class theory held by Sun was based upon a distinction
between power and competence. The people should have <em>power</em>
to determine the range of government policy; they obviously
did not have the <em>competence</em>. Competence was confined to the
intellectual leaders and the thinking people of society (who
were to form two classes) and could not be found in the vast
majority of people untrained to contemplate political problems.
Accordingly, Sun's scheme of government assumed the continuity
of a bureaucracy made up of men of competence, but subject
to the periodic check of the populace, which possessed the power.</p>

<p>Another of Sun's programs relates to the question: How can
democracy be reconciled with ideological control? The Chinese
had lived in a society so completely under the rule of common
ideas that independent individual thinking had to be moderate,
careful, and orthodox in appearance before it met with any
welcome. The individual was not free to think freely; but since
most did not think freely, sensing no need for it, they were
unconscious of control. A problem larger than that of individual
freedom is raised by the question of ideological control, since
the controlled individual himself transmits control to his neighbors
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_61" title="pg 61"> </a>
and his dependents. The ideology must be filtered, as it
were, at some point. Sun believed that democracy would
effectuate the filtering, allowing long-range revision from outside
the bureaucracy. He expected that the bureaucracy of democratic
China would rule well but would be subject to control
from a people not completely under its thumb. The ideology
was to be officially fostered, but it was to be subject to the check
of the electorate. The Chinese were still to use orthodoxy
as a tool of control and social pressure as the major instrument
of constraint, but they were not to be allowed to fall into a blind
traditionalism which would isolate them.</p>

<p>The old ideology was to be adjusted and supplemented with
Western science, so that the new would be compounded of three
things: old Chinese social and political experience, old Chinese
ethical knowledge, and modern scientific truth. With respect
to Western science, the Nationalists had to present few startling
governmental innovations, since the need for a knowledge of the
physical and technical sciences was widely recognized in China&mdash;not
only by the Nationalists. That the Western technology
should serve to build the new China was obvious; trade schools
needed encouragement rather than initiation. As to the old
Chinese social and political experience, the Kuomintang stressed
study of China's past. They attempted to mend the gap
between the generation born in the 1880's and that born in the
1910's by encouraging concentration on the classical texts,
reverently, but critically as well. Archaeology has heightened
interest of the Chinese in their past. As a consequence, their
sense of national value has deepened.</p>

<p>For the restoration of the old Chinese moral and ethical system
the New Life movement, which has been fostered personally by
Generalissimo Chiang K'ai-shek, is of great importance. Its
principles consist of a simple restatement of the cardinal Confucian
personal virtues, interpreted to suit modern conditions.
It has presumably been influenced by Protestant Christianity,
and may be said to be a form of puritanism. Although the
Nationalist movement has not been as successful in ten years as
was the Confucian in two hundred, it has at least created a
state pattern. A state in the full sense would require a type
of organization so clear in its ideology that people would personify
it willingly, would accord it existence whether leaders and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" title="pg 62"> </a>
governments fell or not, and would be loyal to it and to those
who claimed to wield its power.</p>

<p>Among negative influences running against the Nationalist
ideology, the Nationalist neo-militarism has stood forth. As in
the other ideologically integrated states of the world (Russia,
Germany, Italy), the army assumed especial importance because
its type of law and order required no common understanding
higher than the assent of idiots. An army is the one institution
where complete harmony of thought is a luxury and not a
necessity, where simple agreement on rewards, punishments, and
organization morale will hold the structure together. The
Nationalist armies, however, rose to a new position. Ideological
control was introduced; the literate armies fought best. But
despite the civilian and intellectual factors from outside, the
mere force concentrated in weapons was so great as to amount
to a constant temptation. Whenever the day's fortunes were
inclement, the men in command tended to settle things with
guns. In contrast with sheer ideals, the Nationalists were
strongly military; in contrast with their predecessors, the
Nationalist generals showed respect for civilian authority.
The charge of Nationalist neo-militarism focused upon the personal
popularity of army leaders, especially that of Chiang
K'ai-shek. It can be adjudicated only by history.</p>

<p>The Nationalist movement neared its most drastic ordeal in
1936. The predetermined period of tutelage as decreed was passing,
while the inauguration of constitutional government had to
be deferred. With the approaching abolition of the Party
dictatorship the Nationalist leaders were to demonstrate their
consistency with their own ideals and programs. The programs
of Sun Yat-sen called for the abdication of the patriotic elite,
and the requirement&mdash;coupled as it had been with the proclamation
of definite time limits&mdash;placed the issue squarely before the
Kuomintang leadership. Were they to attempt the democratic
experiment in a nation patently unripe for it, or were they to
disavow the commands of their deceased and sainted Leader,
and continue in power?</p>

<p>Before the Nationalist movement underwent this final test,
however, other issues arose which swept all previous plans
aside. The kidnaping of Chiang K'ai-shek at Sian, the reconciliation
of the Communists and Nationalists, and the Japanese
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" title="pg 63"> </a>
invasion in 1937 forced Nationalism into concord with all other
patriotic movements and merged them all in a dramatic resurgence
for national defense.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Independent Marxism in China</a></em></p>

<p>The proponents of Marxism were welcomed into China as
trusted friends. In 1926 it was obvious to the whole world
that China was definitely within the orbit of Marxism; in 1935
it was just as apparent that the Marxists faced a military doom,
and that their forcible suppression might mean the end of their
political effectiveness. Never ruined beyond all hope of recovery
and triumph, never successful beyond all danger of disaster, the
Marxists and their doctrines are the greatest uncertainty facing
China.</p>

<p>Sinologues, judging from past experience and impressed with
the deep continuities and repetitions of Chinese history, may well
argue that Marxism is another religious distributive cult such as
periods of turmoil always produce in China. They can point
to the rise and fall of the Yellow Turbans in the third century
<span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, when the two leaders&mdash;the Duke of Heaven and the Duke
of Humanity&mdash;shook the great Han dynasty down into everlasting
ruin. Or they can refer to the T'ai-p'ing rebellion, which
held a territory infinitely greater than that ever occupied by the
Marxists, which impressed a fantastic but politically operative
Christianity upon its followers, and which promised to do in
South China what Brigham Young and the Mormons had done
with the United Order in Utah; but the T'ai-p'ing went down
to an extinction so complete that no living advocate of the cult
practiced by millions seventy years ago can be found today.
Thus it would be no violation of the set patterns of Chinese
history if the movement of Marxism were to rise to world-dazzling
splendor and then pass into utter oblivion. Yet Chinese history
is no longer the only kind of history which holds weight for
precedent in China, and if the T'ai-p'ing rebellion is one example,
the Russian Revolution is another. Bolshevism certainly has
better chances of succeeding in China than it could have seemed
to have&mdash;to anyone but a fanatic&mdash;in the Russia of 1915.</p>

<p>The Marxian doctrines had already eaten well into Chinese
territory before entering upon the Chinese scene proper. One of
the less savory bequests which the tsarist regime left the Communists
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" title="pg 64"> </a>
was the question of Outer Mongolia, a vast stretch of
land under the admitted suzerainty but beyond the real control
of the Chinese. The area was used by White Russians as a base
for operations, and&mdash;whether or not it accorded with their
principles&mdash;the Red forces had to cross the frontier to pacify
Siberia. Once in, they could not get out. It was essentially
the sort of absent-minded conquest which has contributed so
much to the British Empire: a strategic occupation leading
inevitably to political domination. The Russians compromised
as well as they might, setting up an Outer Mongolian People's
Republic and administering the area in the way which the world
was to observe on a much grander scale in the case of the Japanese
in Manchuria&mdash;through advisers.</p>

<p>Marxism became a force in China through men and literature
and money and arms reaching China by the sea route, as have
most Western things. Its position reflected, however, the facts
that Russia is China's greatest neighbor and that the Russo-Chinese
land frontier is one of the longest in the world. China
is much nearer to San Francisco, in terms of shipping costs and
speed of connections, than it is to Leningrad, but the appearance
of closer proximity to the latter played a considerable role.
The Nationalist-Communist coalition<sup><a href="#fn34" id="r34">4</a></sup> was the result of the
impact of Marxism from Russia upon China proper. The Communists
entered as allies, not as leaders. The period of Nationalist-Communist
cooperation lasted because the practical projects
of the two revolutionary parties lay in a common direction.
The gradual shift in the role of the Communists from advisers
and allies to teachers and masters led to the break between
the two organizations.</p>

<p>How did this shift develop? From the Marxian standpoint
it was the move of a party leadership which was bound by a true
ideology, that of dialectic materialism. Whatever the ethics
of broken individual pledges, there is no question that the Communists
were justified according to their own beliefs in abandoning
the Nationalists when the Nationalists ceased positive
revolutionary action and began a Nationalist reconstitution.
The Communists felt themselves bound to take up the standards
of the revolution and proceed against Nationalists as against
others. There was no room in the Marxian ideology for anything
but the officially approved Communist Party; there was no
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_65" title="pg 65"> </a>
ground for conceding that the Nationalists might be wise in
calling a breathing spell.</p>

<p>The Kuomintang leaders, on the other hand, had every reason
to feel aggrieved at the Communists. The Communists had
come to help the Chinese revolutionaries in their struggle for
national liberation and to bring about a common front against
imperialism in the Far East. When the revolution of national
liberation was more than half accomplished, the Communists
had increased their following to such an extent that they regarded
the Nationalist alliance as a mere episode in the growth of
Marxian power in China. Marxists had come to help the cause
of Sun Yat-sen; Marxism was spread to fight and undo it. The
sobering shock of a grasp on power sent the Nationalists into
relative conservatism. An eminent Chinese writer has suggested
the change of mood:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our imagination was fired, our enthusiasm was kindled; thousands of
young men have fled from home and school from the outermost provinces
to join the Nationalist forces; they have toiled and they have
sweated, and thousands have gladly laid down their lives on the altar
of Nationalism that their dream of a regenerated and redeemed China
might come true. But, alas!... The war has ended&mdash;so has all
idealism.<sup><a href="#fn35" id="r35">5</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The Soviet Communists, deprived of their opportunity to
broadcast propaganda on a large scale, and unable to ride the
back of the Nationalist tiger any longer, found themselves on a
defensive which seemed to be permanent. At the same time,
the Marxists in China encountered difficulties in adjusting their
ideology to the fact that their strength lay in elements which
official Marxism discredited. They owed their existence to
agrarian discontent and to their excellent army&mdash;the shock
troops, in many cases, of the former coalition. The leader of
Chinese Marxism, Ch'en Tu-hsiu, broke the party wide open
with a schism; he believed in modernizing effort rather than
orthodox Marxist symbols. Other schisms from the Left
produced Marxisms intent on applying the European technique to
China's small proletariat, indifferent to the land question and
eager to make an Asiatic revolution from the textbooks of
European labor conflict. Such deviations were as unrealistic
and sterile as Blanquism, against which the nineteenth century
Marxists inveighed so heavily. Even so the official Communist
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" title="pg 66"> </a>
Party withstood nine years of savage attack and persecution
because necessity forced the Reds to pursue a simple line of
policy&mdash;survival. Out of the test of deadly experience the
Chinese Communists evolved means of allying themselves with
the discontented peasantry, and found the point at which further
social reform yielded diminishing returns in popular support.
In relying on the people for practical help, instead of invoking
theoretically popular appeals, the Chinese Communists attained
a defensive strength which could easily be turned into an offensive.</p>

<p>The reorientation in attitude&mdash;the splitting off of both extremes,
the iron necessity for an immediate and effectual popularization
of the Party among the peasantry, and the lessons
derived from responding to actual conditions&mdash;enabled the
Communists to establish a state in Kiangsi in 1931: the Chinese
Soviet Republic.<sup><a href="#fn36" id="r36">6</a></sup> In 1935 and 1936 Chiang K'ai-shek began the
most vigorous of his attacks, which led to the removal of the
Chinese Red Army some two thousand miles from South Central
to Northwest China&mdash;one of the most astonishing military feats
of modern times. Some observers have suggested that Chiang
had no intention of allowing the Communists to disappear altogether
from the scene, as they provided his military power
with a <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> in the eyes of the Japanese. Had he run
them utterly to ground, the Japanese might have dispensed with
him. Later events have made such an explanation seem less
persuasive, after the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> at Sian in December, 1936.</p>

<p>The personal factors and political events in this extraordinary
drama are not yet known in their entirety, and it may be decades
before the whole story is pieced together from the accounts of
eyewitnesses and interpreters. Chiang K'ai-shek in his published
diary mentions no formal agreement for the institution of a
United Front policy, but the rumors from the Left persist in
affirming the existence of a truce between the Nationalists and
the Communists, the fruits of which were to be action against
Japan. Certainly the military and political effects of Chiang's
kidnaping were substantial,<sup><a href="#fn37" id="r37">7</a></sup> and the ideological scarcely less.
In brief, the kidnaping arose from action on the part of Chinese
National Army troops under the command of Chang Hs&uuml;eh-liang,
the ex-<em>tuch&uuml;n</em> of Manchuria. His forces were mostly from
the Manchurian provinces and had no stomach for fighting the
Communists in the far west of China while the Japanese remained
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" title="pg 67"> </a>
in undisturbed occupation of their homelands. They had
inaugurated an informal understanding with the Communists,
and fraternization had begun between the opposing armies.
When Chiang came up to investigate conditions, he was promptly
kidnaped (December, 1936). His bodyguard was slaughtered
and he himself was injured in the spine. The kidnaping was
nominally the act of the <em>Tungpei</em> (ex-Manchurian) troops. Even
the Communist forces worked for the release of Chiang, since
they felt that his death would mean national disaster. The
release of Chiang was finally procured through the mediation of
an Australian editor with a long experience in Chinese politics.<sup><a href="#fn38" id="r38">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The effect on popular thinking was twofold. In the first place,
Chiang's popularity was made fully apparent by the vigor of the
demonstrations in his favor all over China. It had long been
asserted that even the most momentary relaxation of Chiang's
despotism, as its opponents termed it, would be followed either
by anarchy or a new revolutionary regime. Neither appeared.
The strength of the National Government as a government was
apparent, despite a strong odor of treason in widely separated
quarters, and the people as a whole kept quiet. Students,
workers, capitalists, officials, military men&mdash;all groups sought
Chiang's release. Their anxiety for his personal safety was in
some cases qualified by a hearty dislike of the man himself, but
almost everyone admitted to an admiration, either grudging or
whole-hearted, for the effectiveness of his work. The National
Government and its chief military leader were indeed strongly
entrenched in popular sympathy and thought&mdash;more so than
even the most optimistic observers had dared to hope.</p>

<p>The second consequence of the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> at Sian was even
more important. The mere physical juxtaposition of the two
leaderships, Marxian and Nationalist, and the probability that
forced arbitration would be the result of the kidnaping, led to a
wild stimulation of hopes. At the same time it was generally
realized that failure to come to terms might end in the murder
of Chiang and in fateful results for all groups in China. The
kidnapers demanded a United Front; the Communists had
issued a manifesto in behalf of it several months earlier (August
1, 1936). The problem was: could Chiang accede without ruining
his prestige or impairing the ideological position he had so
laboriously built up for himself?</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" title="pg 68"> </a></p>

<p>A compromise was found, which amounted to a paper victory
for Chiang, nominal punishment of Chang and the other perpetrators
of the kidnaping, ceremonial apology to the nation by
Chiang for having been kidnaped, and a series of formally
unrelated but probably linked events&mdash;all of which brought the
two ideologies and their adherents to a common ground.
Throughout the following spring, progress was made in the
negotiation of a truce, which broadened into an armistice and
ended as an alliance. On April 30, 1937, for instance, the Young
Communist Congress, composed of men whose brains Chiang
would have cheerfully blown out a few months before, elected
Chiang and other Nationalist leaders to honorary membership.
On occasion, the Communists and the Nationalists exchanged
classical Chinese poems; each side sought to excel in sincere
courtesy. The armistice lasted through the period of the
Japanese invasion in the summer of 1937; formal union was
achieved in September.<sup><a href="#fn39" id="r39">9</a></sup></p>

<p>On the political surface, the course of Marxism in China has
been one of the most startling developments in modern history.
Alliance between Hitler and Stalin would seem more plausible
than the reunion of Nationalist and Communist groups in China.
To those in the service of the Nanking regime in 1936, such an
eventuality was the one thing certain not to happen. The break
between the Marxist and Nationalist leaderships and their subsequent
reconciliation appeared, however, less improbable in
consideration of the course steered by the Communist world
movement during the decade 1927-1937. The United Front
in China made it possible for the Chinese Communists to concede
more than they would otherwise have dared to except at
the suggestion of the Russian and international Communists.</p>

<p>The future role of Marxism in China is still undecided. Nothing
can be regarded as beyond the limit of probability, except
the immediate establishment of a permanent and unalterable
regime. The challenges the Marxists raise are too important to
be ignored&mdash;land and labor reform and the devising of workable
techniques for distributive justice. If they do not take control
of the country themselves, they will at least be a formidable
factor for whoever does control the government. In the event
of foreign conquest the Marxians could provide an underground
resistance of spectacular value. If the Chinese, applying terror
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_69" title="pg 69"> </a>
and espionage against the Marxians then regarded as traitors,
were not able to root them out in ten years of ferocious warfare,
what will aliens do&mdash;against Communists who have become
patriots in the eyes of all the people and who are assured help from
all sides?</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Japanese Efforts to Participate in Creating a New China</a></em></p>

<p>China is Japan's greatest outside problem; she is only a
secondary problem in the foreign policies of the other great
powers. Japan owes much to China in the way of borrowed
ideas and institutions. Japan and Siam are the only free nations
in the modern world which share with China the background of
a Chinese-dominated world society in the Far East.<sup><a href="#fn40" id="r40">10</a></sup> The
Japanese resisted the extension of Chinese suzerainty to their
islands, and on only one occasion did they concede formally
that the Chinese emperor was the head of all civilized society;
this they bitterly regret. While the Siamese have maintained
their independence, they are in no position to take an active
part in the creation of a new Far East, and the issue is between
China and Japan, with the other Pacific powers largely as spectators.
The construction of a way of thinking to accommodate
the men and territories no longer guided by the old order is a
problem shared by Japan and China; the competition for imposing
a feasible system is sharp. Japan wishes to create a new Far
East in which the Japanese shall constitute the most cultured
core; the Chinese take their ancient position for granted.</p>

<p>In addition to the ideational conflict for prestige between
Chinese and Japanese, there is another realm wherein the two
nations compete, using ideas not as ends but as means. The
extension of Western industry and trade to the East produced
acute dislocations both in China and in Japan, and in the case of
Japan involved transforming the Japanese autarchy into a most
dangerous dependence upon a share of the world economy.
Japan is truly a commercial and capitalist power; hers is no mere
affectation of modernity. It is conceivable, should the West
go down to its Armageddon, that the Chinese might swing back
to the ways of their past. The Japanese could not; their economic
and political system has expanded too far. They are
inextricably bound up with the rest of the industrial, capitalist
modern world. In China the stock exchanges have a mere toehold
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" title="pg 70"> </a>
on the country; in Japan they have become the spine of
national life. The Japanese must either pay the price of modernization
by accepting the lowly place of the latecomer or make
up their tardiness in entering the imperialist scene by a veritable
frenzy of expansion. Apart from the future of capitalism, there
remains the question: Will Japan collapse before reaching
imperial success in the world economy?</p>

<p>China and the unpredictable but colossal Chinese markets are
Japan's goal, formulated after contact with the West. China
and her unquestioned cultural prestige are the targets of the
Japanese drive for the acquisition of standing, a campaign
couched in indigenous Far Eastern terms. The conflict between
the two countries weaves its way back and forth through elaborate
and self-contradictory sets of terms. The Japanese have
toyed with a multitude of policies for China. Some of these are:
(1) simple conquest; (2) the establishment of a peculiar Far
Eastern order under Japanese leadership&mdash;either in terms
harmonious with Western concepts of international affairs (the
"Japanese Monroe Doctrine") or in terms derived from a modification
of the past ("Pan-Asia"); (3) a common cause of
Japanese and Chinese against the white peril, without any special
emphasis on the relative positions of the two countries; (4) a
divine Japanese mission, not merely to save the yellow race but
to rescue the whole world and put all nations under the protecting
benevolence of Japanese overlordship; (5) a strict policy
of day-to-day opportunism&mdash;binding those parts of China
accessible for such procedure with treaties and agreements, and
catching the Chinese as they come forth into the arena of
modern economic life; (6) expediency couched in military terms,
looking to absolute Japanese gains on the map, regardless of the
erection of a social system to perpetuate the immediate military
advances; (7) a pro-Chinese policy, to assure the Japanese a
close ally (but in such a case a strong independent China would
inevitably excel Japan, and the Japanese would have to yield to
Chinese hegemony&mdash;however friendly&mdash;or else retreat from it
into the isolation from which they emerged in the 1850's).</p>

<p>Direct military conquest has a considerable appeal to the
Japanese, except for its limitations. All the armies of the modern
world would not be enough to garrison and patrol a China
desperately hostile through and through. The Chinese would
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" title="pg 71"> </a>
not stop at suicide to embarrass their enemies, if there were
complete ideological antagonism. The Japanese would have to
persuade the Chinese whom they conquered to remain alive, to
keep working, to grow wealthy so that the conquest might not
be without value. It is not possible to consider a policy involving
the outright murder of from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred million persons; short of such extermination, there is
no way for the Japanese to clear the field for colonization in
Chinese territories. If the Japanese cannot replace the Chinese,
they must make use of them; to make use of them, they must
teach them to think in a way which will permit exploitation,
for even the most inequitable exploitation involves some
cooperation.</p>

<p>Ever since their peculiar Far Eastern order had been partially
recognized the Japanese began building up theories of a zone
of influence to be based not upon law but upon geographic and
racial fact. The doctrines of Pan-Asia fitted their purpose.
Writers in the different Asiatic countries had pointed out the
desirability of a union of those Asiatic peoples which were not
yet under colonial rule to prevent further occidental advance
and to rescue their conquered neighbors. Sun Yat-sen himself
thought well of the Pan-Asia idea and stressed it, along with the
recommendation that all economically exploited powers confront
the exploiting powers&mdash;a class war between nations.
As soon as the Japanese began turning to Pan-Asia for furtherance
of their own peculiar ends, these arguments lost much of their
realism. The Japanese policies generated more disturbance in
Asia than did the Western. Their call to prevent Western
aggression, at a time when the Western powers were in retreat,
sounded artificial. Nevertheless, the Pan-Asian movement
forms a link between ideology-conscious leaders in China and
Japan; Japan's ultra-patriotic Toyama had been friendly and
helpful to Sun at the time when the former led the <em>Genyosha</em>
and the latter the <em>Hsing Chung Hui</em>.<sup><a href="#fn41" id="r41">11</a></sup> It was natural, however,
that the Pan-Asian doctrine, although it never disappeared
altogether in China, should be strongest in Japan. Pan-Asia
or its restricted form&mdash;Far-Easternism (<em>Toa-shugi</em>)&mdash;played
a significant part in the military indoctrination in Japan,
even though attempts to propagate it in China ended in almost
complete failure.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" title="pg 72"> </a></p>

<p>To the ideological conquest of China the Japanese have
contributed very little. Their theories, summed up, amount
to but a drop in the sea of doctrines. Only as the spokesman of
China's ultra-reactionary monarchists&mdash;who flourished twenty-five
years ago&mdash;has Japan presented an ideological program
which is other than derisible. Rich in the ceremonial trappings
of government, and in the personal elegance of its powerless
ministers, the Great Manchou Empire makes a strong appeal to
literary persons with archaic tastes. Even there, the blunt
modernism of the Japanese military machine destroys the illusion.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Patriotism: The United Front</a></em></p>

<p>1937 was one of the most critical years of modern China.
It marked a swift and startling grouping of the three active
forces in China: Nationalism, Communism, and Japanese
compulsion. For ten years the Nationalists and the Communists
had waged a war of terror against each other; for six
years a Chinese Soviet Republic had defied the National Government
of China established at Nanking. Six years had passed
since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, five since the establishment
of a Manchoukuo government. The Nationalists had
hated the Japanese, but they hated the Communists more;
at the humiliating price of non-resistance to Japan, Chiang
K'ai-shek had brought the full military and agitational power
of Nationalism to the suppression of the Marxians. The
Japanese had no great attachment to Chiang and the Nationalists
and regarded Nationalism itself as a force subversive to Japanese
order in the Far East. But they had tolerated the Kuomintang
because it seemed a buffer between themselves and the Communists,
and because they did not have the power or the immediate
inclination to destroy the Nationalist regime.</p>

<p>This triangular deadlock was first broken by the kidnaping
at Sian. Nationalist and Communist leaderships were brought
face to face, and preliminary terms were agreed upon. With
each step toward a termination of the Nationalist-Communist
wars the danger of a powerful China became more striking to
Japan, while simultaneously the Nanking regime became less
valuable to the Japanese as a bulwark against Communism.
The spring of 1937 marked the settlement with the Communists
in the Northwest, the continuance of a general armistice, and the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_73" title="pg 73"> </a>
sharp improvement of Nationalist prestige throughout the country.
Circles which had been Rightist recognized the increased
military and financial power of the Nationalists, now that the
long and wasteful struggle with the Communists was ended,
releasing men, weapons, and money for application in other
quarters. Leftist groups again found the Nanking state philosophy
palatable, and discovered in the official tenets of the Nationalist
Party enough common principles to justify the re-coalition
of revolutionary forces. The radical intellectuals and students,
who had swung sharply to the Left as a result of continued Nationalist
yielding to Japan, turned again to Nationalist leadership.</p>

<p>As practical solutions to the Nationalist-Communist conflict
were found, the people in the larger cities were released from the
governmental restrictions which the Nationalists&mdash;upon Japanese
insistence and threat of force&mdash;had placed on the expression of
patriotic sentiments. A vast and vigorous patriotic feeling came
suddenly to life, having grown more intense under the cramping
inhibitions of police prohibition. The patriotism was revolutionary
in mood but not wholly different from Chinese patriotism
of the past. The slogans all centered on national defense.
Release of political prisoners, cessation of internal war, and
democratization of the government were regarded as steps to
union and defense.</p>

<p>When the Japanese decided to push forward in earnest and
began fighting in North China in the summer of 1937, the
patriotic movement became so powerful that for the time it
supplanted all other separate movements. Only a number
of aged or cynical opportunists remained outside. It was now
possible, under the slogan of a United Front of all China against
Japan, to disregard the fundamental differences between the
Nationalists and the Communists. A Chinese Communist wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>While we declare ourselves, despite the differences in principle that
exist between communism and Sun-Yat-sen-ism, advocates of the basic
revolutionary slogans of Sun Yat-sen, of the best revolutionary traditions
of the Chinese people, we Communists never for an instant under
any circumstances cease to be true followers of the Marxist-Leninist
teachings.<sup><a href="#fn42" id="r42">12</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Such utterances were matched by similar ones from the Nationalist
side.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" title="pg 74"> </a></p>

<p>In their haste the Japanese utilized an ideology which they had
practiced in Manchuria&mdash;literary Confucianism colored by
notions adopted from the Japanese cult of the emperor. They
also appealed to the practical and immediate needs of the Chinese
living in the areas which they conquered, setting up governments<sup><a href="#fn43" id="r43">13</a></sup>
to govern for them. But this was hardly more than an
expedient. Of far greater importance than even the war itself
is its long-range impact upon the Chinese mind.</p>

<p>The formulation of the present Chinese patriotic movement
into a definite drive for the establishment of a new Chinese way
of life may emerge as one of the lasting facts of the century.
The various movements of the Republican era failed to disturb
and arouse the masses sufficiently to make possible a replacement
of the decrepit remnants of the old Chinese social and intellectual
world, or a reinterpretation adding the ingredients needed in a
modern civilization. If patriotism unites the Chinese permanently,
Japanese invasion may have provoked what twenty-five
years of Chinese effort could not bring about.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Chinese have reacted to the emergencies of
war in a manner almost unprecedented among modern nations.
War has not meant the creation of a temporary despotism; it
has brought democracy instead. The ideological concord, the
supremacy of a common national purpose, which could not be
achieved in a quarter century of peacetime agony, was brought
forth in the ordeal of national resistance. Democracy and not
tyranny was the unifying force. The Kuomintang Party Congress,
meeting in Hankow from March 29 to April 2, 1938,
reaffirmed the primacy of the <em>San Min Chu I</em>, but at the same
time guaranteed the sanctity of private rights, even in wartime,
of groups who had been liable to official suppression for years.
The Communist press was flourishing openly in Hankow, a
testimony to the curious tolerance with which the Chinese united
for national defense. The governmental structure was increasingly
democratized. Japan had provided a body of common
assumptions strong enough to sustain democracy, despite the
burden of mutually tolerated disagreements.</p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> IV</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">WARRIORS</a></h2>


<p>From the outside, militarism seems to dominate the Chinese
scene. China is frequently interpreted in terms of personalities
instead of mass inclinations, wide-filtering habits, and extensive
relocations of thought. The picturesqueness of the Chinese
leaders has done nothing to prevent the notion of many romantic
autocracies from appearing real: the Dog-Meat General, six
feet tall, diabolically cruel and brazenly comic, with his veritable
zoological garden of ladies from all over the world; the Christian
General, burly, bluff, honest, Christian and Bolshevik, with the
happy na&iuml;vet&eacute; of a feudal politician; the Bandit General and his
infatuation with fine arsenals; the Generalissimo, with his Christian
wife, himself a Christian, rolling up a military machine
against the third greatest naval power of the earth&mdash;such figures
make Chinese news a confused but exciting serial story.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Military Rule and Political Economy</a></em></p>

<p>For long-range effects, the literary experiments of men like
Hu Shih and the mass-education drive of Dr. James Yen and his
associates are more significant than any one of hundreds of
military leaders, but long-range trends are never news. The
armies and their commanders have occupied the center of the
stage, overshadowing the quest of the Chinese for civilian rule.
Civilian rule, however, presupposes a sufficient area of common
agreement on which to build laws and usages for government;
armies require nothing but a nearly mechanical discipline and
the crudest rule of thumb administration. The civilian government
of Republican China has had to await the coming of at
least a minimum of order out of the turmoil; armies, for lack of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_77" title="pg 77"> </a>
government, have dominated and continued that turmoil.
China has been disunited in great part because she was impoverished
by military rule; she has been ruled by arms partly because
she was disunited. No unifier of the nation would have needed
to maintain the armed hordes which were the greatest impediment
to real national defense&mdash;hordes powerful enough to wreck
governments but not powerful enough to build them. The war
lords, as they are perhaps too flatteringly termed, do by no means
measure up to the note of the intellectual and political leaders;
but they have unquestionably held the greater bulk of day-to-day
authority in China since 1912.</p>

<p>The most significant function of the armies is one which is
quite frequently overlooked: their power as agencies of unsettlement.
They have created disturbances more profound than
mere public disorder; they have attacked institutions more vital
than the public treasury; they have kept all parts of China from
the dull apathy of conservatism. The arrogance and rapacity
of the military rulers, their utter incompetence as administrators
(with a number of honorable exceptions), and their ineffectiveness
as propagandists have provided that loose and haphazard
tyranny which some philosophers consider the prime
requisite for social ferment. The military men have never
been intelligent enough to impose truly totalitarian regimes,
nor efficient enough to make the people of any one area content
with a permanent separatism. The presence of the military rank
and file has turned the Chinese social system upside down,
reversing the accepted scale of ranks within the society and
infringing upon the interests of every group&mdash;even the minimum
interest of the very poor, their right not to starve to death. More
conspicuously, the armies have given a picture of power which,
in contrast with the scarcely traceable lines of influence and persuasion
arising from ideological movements, is intelligible and
reducible to concrete terms.</p>

<p>Without the militarists, there would have been no visible
series of events to trace the change in China, no stereotypes at
all by which to show the immediate alterations on the scene of
power. Many men did rise and fall regardless of military considerations,
but such occurrences were loosely and popularly
ascribed to intrigue or else dismissed as beyond all rational understanding.
The armies subsisted and roamed about, leaders
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" title="pg 78"> </a>
and men both helpless on a sea of ignorance and doctrinal conflict;
but the mere assent to unthinking discipline looked like order,
and the most shadowy and insubstantial military hierarchy
held out a promise of Caesarian peace. From 1915 to 1925
foreign comment stressed the movements of the war lords,
singling out the man who might play the role of a Chinese
Napoleon, and to the present this simple approach satisfies many.
Meanwhile the foundations of social life shifted, falling away here,
growing more solid there, behind the gloomy panorama of brutal,
ineffectual warfare.</p>

<p>Closely related to the problem of armies was another category
partially understandable in narrowly factual terms&mdash;political
economy. The armies conditioned and set the pace, a slow one,
for economic development. All financial projects were jeopardized
by military rule, both by the exactions which the military
might impose and by the constant threat that militarists, devaluating
the currency or arbitrarily changing the political controls of
economy, might alter the very economic system in which the
project was being considered and fostered. Economic life in
China could not continue through the traditional agricultural,
guild, semicapitalist devices; Western trade and social dislocation
prevented that. Yet no new economy could automatically
replace the ruins of the old, since economic matters were part of a
<em>political</em> economy subject to the extra-economic interferences
which ideological change, military power, and halfway government
could impose. One of the truly important achievements of
the National Government at Nanking was the creation of a
core for a twentieth century army. But all the military achievements
in modern China pale before the staggering surprise of a
managed currency, displacing a commodity and specie system
which was older than all modern warfare.</p>

<p>One need not subscribe to either military or economic determinism
to concede the relevance of military and economic matters
in any society. In China there exists a peculiarly close correlation
between the two. The absence of a class founded squarely
on economic privilege and the subordination of the military to
the bureaucratic elements in the imperial society were largely
the result of the position occupied by the average nonacademic
Chinese, who was typically a farmer capable of being a militiaman
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_79" title="pg 79"> </a>
or a bandit. This duality of role strongly affected the
development of government in China, and is a factor which still
plays a great part. The Chinese owe many of their social and
political peculiarities to the effectiveness of their mass action,
which is able to take place with a minimum of formal leadership
and coordination and with a maximum of secrecy and totality.
In times when foreign conquest of China is no longer in the realm
of the improbable, it is worth remembering that the Chinese are
a people adamant in resistance to force and schooled in centuries
of rebellion. Neither pacific nor military resistance could take
place in the traditional Chinese way without the diffusion of
military and economic power among broad masses of the
population.</p>

<p>How, it may be asked, have the Chinese succeeded in being
such a peaceful people, and yet a people so prone to popular
uprising? How is it that, with their great talents for organization,
they have let a shabby third-rate militarism sweep their
land in modern times? The Chinese generals did not command
the allegiance widely extended to even the meanest of South
American despots; yet the people trembled before them. Not
until the war lords lost power was there great popular enthusiasm
for military ideals. If Chinese armies are considered solely as
rough and primitive parallels to their European counterparts,
paradox will follow paradox without rational explanation. To
understand the Chinese military situation one must go back
across the centuries and trace a system and a tradition which, at
times obscure and frequently submerged, must come to the
surface in the decisions upon which rest the question of national
life or death for China.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Downfall of the Charioteers</a></em></p>

<p>The Chinese have differed from other peoples not in being
peaceful so much as in extolling peace. Not even in the Christian
tradition of peace and love are there condemnations of war
stronger than those of the Confucians. Yet, century to century,
the Chinese have known war against the outside barbarians and
with each other. Throughout historic times there are records of
struggle and slaughter. H. G. Creel writes, "If we are to locate
the traditional Chinese time of 'great peace' it must be far back
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_80" title="pg 80"> </a>
in the Neolithic stage. Experts agree that in the earlier of the
Neolithic sites known to us there is little evidence of warfare."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="r44">1</a></sup></p>

<p>At the very edge of history, about 1500 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, the Chinese appear
as accomplished archers, using bows which were probably not
dissimilar to those in use down to the twentieth century&mdash;heavy
reflex bows, with a pull that was sometimes far greater than the
longbow of the celebrated English yeomen of medieval times.
The pellet bow, a form of slingshot, was also common in the
earliest times. Armor was known in the earliest historic dynasty,
the Shang, which by Chinese tradition is dated 1765-1123 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
The chariot, however, seems to have been less widely used than
it later came to be.<sup><a href="#fn45" id="r45">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Under the Chou dynasty, in all Chinese history the most
caste-bound, militaristic, and feudal (traditionally dated 1122-256
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>), the implements of warfare and the management of
conflict fell into the hands of the ruling class. Previous to the
Chou there was a relative military equality of all, despite the
sharp lines between masters and men. After the Chou the
great military states culminating in the warrior-bureaucrat
tyranny of the Ch'in Shih Huang Ti (third century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) tended
to reduce war to mass movements, in which establishments,
management, and broader considerations constantly increased.
During this period the master class developed a scheme which
was not as elaborately traced out in legal terms as Norman-English
feudalism, nor as solidly grounded in outright military
effectiveness as the Japanese system twenty-odd centuries later,
but which amounted to a chivalric order within the limits of an
ideology rooted in the family. The lords were the spiritual
guardians and clan leaders as well as the earthly despots of their
subjects. Standing above the law and invested with positions of
high political dignity, their class nearly became a caste. Warfare&mdash;as
apart from slaughter&mdash;was formalized and ritualized
beyond all Western dreams of gallantry. According to Marcel
Granet, who has brilliantly described public life of the period,</p>

<blockquote><p>The battle is a confused m&eacute;l&eacute;e of boasts, generosities, homages,
insults, devotions, curses, blessings and sorceries. Much more than a
clash of arms, it is a duel of moral values, an encounter of competing
honours.... The battle is the great moment in which each warrior
proves his nobility, while in addition they prove to all present the
nobility of their prince, their cause and their country.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="r46">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_81" title="pg 81"> </a></p>

<p>Our very word <em>chivalry</em> suggests horsemen; the Chinese nobles
ruled their elaborate realm not from horseback but from chariots.
The education of every patrician youth involved archery, music,
writing, and reckoning, among other arts and virtues.<sup><a href="#fn47" id="r47">4</a></sup> Archery
was something which might be learned, after a fashion, by large
numbers of common men; even peasants, with a bow and a lance
or pike, might constitute light cavalry when provided, or providing
themselves, with mounts. But the use of the four-horse
chariot necessarily remained the exclusive privilege of the nobles.
The chariot fighter had to have a driver and one or two others
with him in his vehicle, which was itself costly, hard to obtain,
and difficult to operate. A Chou noble driving forth to war
thirty centuries ago was as technical a unit as an aviator in a
combat plane today or a small group of men in a tank. Just
as there is a democracy implicit in the light machine gun or the
automatic rifle, so was there the potentiality of equality in vast
masses of infantry, supported by light, cheaply armed cavalry.
Aristocratic individualism meant something when wars were
short and fought with elaborate equipment; but no noble could
stand up against the mass forces which emerged and continued
fighting until the feudal system lost any real significance and
left the country open to the development of bureaucratic government
and military power.</p>

<p>There was no overt attack on the feudal system. The system,
however, possessed within itself contradictions which led to its
doom. The central power was insufficient to keep the peace, and
certain local groups were&mdash;by talent, economic factors, or
geography&mdash;too strong to remain subordinate. The period
known as the Spring and Autumn epoch (Ch'un Ch'iu; 770-473
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) yielded to that known as the Age of Warring States (Chan
Kuo; 473-221 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>). From feudal cores there grew states,
which began to follow the course of development that led to the
appearance of a system of sovereign nations in Europe; they
increasingly interfered with the free operation of the feudal
economy. By effecting the massing of power they eliminated
the overawing charioteer from the field of decisive combat.<sup><a href="#fn48" id="r48">5</a></sup>
The chariots remained as the vehicles of the leaders or the focal
points of battles, but they no longer implied a skill so great as to
make up a monopoly of first-rate military force. While the
most eminent thinker of the age, Confucius, lamented the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_82" title="pg 82"> </a>
decline of order, a new order was being shaped from the social,
economic, and military realities laid bare by rapid development,
Machiavellian intrigue, and the hard necessities of wartime
economies.</p>

<p>The state of Ch'in, a Chinese Prussia, attained overwhelming
hegemony in the third century before Christ. Its power rested
on universal registration of the inhabitants, conscription, heavy
policing, taxation involving constant intervention in economic
matters, and legalistic administration. In its warfare there
was little of the ritual which characterized the military period
when chariots were dominant; codes did not amount to much.
The immediate end of war was slaughter for political and economic
purposes, not the hazardous parade of a feudal class.
The Ch'in monarch who finally established a centralized empire
took the vainglorious title of Shih Huang Ti (The First Emperor),
and set himself the task of eradicating the regionalist ideologies
of his conquered rivals by suppressing all political history but
that of his native state. Proceeding from innovation to innovation,
he ended by becoming one of the historic figures detested
by later epochs. One of the practices which he extended throughout
the Empire of China was the regularization of military
service. He is also known as the originator of the grandiose
project of the Great Wall; it is less well known that he forbade
the erection of walls around cities within the Empire. His
system of conscription involved three years of compulsory
military service for all young men, and a corvee of three days'
service each year at the frontier for every citizen; the former
came to depend for its inclusiveness upon administrative integrity,
while the latter was soon replaced by a money tax.</p>

<p>Although the First Empire established by the Ch'in did not
last long, the Han dynasty (202 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> to <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 220) continued its
military system<sup><a href="#fn49" id="r49">6</a></sup> and kept standing armies at the northern
frontier and at the imperial capital. The frontier forces were
composed of militia augmented for special campaigns by volunteers
and criminals. The Chinese fought the barbarians with
the tactics of mounted archers, devices learned from the nomads.
Away from the northern steppes, infantry seems to have gained
constantly in importance. By the time of Christ the chivalry
of the religious-social-military class of charioteers was ancient
history, and mass armies had taken their place.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_83" title="pg 83"> </a></p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Military Elements in Chinese Imperial History</a></em></p>

<p>Through the greater part of the past two thousand years,
Chinese society has been governed by civilians. The scholastic
bureaucracy secured and kept a position of primacy, and a
common ranking of the social classes was: scholars, farmers,
merchants, soldiers. The Confucians were antagonistic to war,
and bureaucrats&mdash;if for governmental reasons alone&mdash;suspected
the danger which lay in the broad dissemination of military
knowledge. The Chinese consistently ranked the military man
below the civilian; as a natural consequence most of the abler men
went into scholarship and politics. Chinese history has its great
military names and ample accounts of spectacular military
exploits, but even here the elements of strategy, of diplomatic
and cunning warfare, rate higher than in the corresponding
European histories. Despite the fact that arms did not play
as great a role in Chinese history as in Western, the difference is
one of degree only; military considerations appeared and persisted
which colored governmental action and social organization.
Among these was the relation of the armed forces to the social
order&mdash;in point of numbers and in point of force. When elections
are lacking in a civilized society, fighting power demarcates an
electorate of force, as it were; the distribution of power determines
the center of political gravity as located in the society. In China
there were, however, elements distinctly different from those
in the West.</p>

<p>One of these was the correlation of mass power and military
power. In epoch after epoch, armies seem to spring forth out of
the very soil&mdash;armed groups radically unlike the Roman legion.
For seasoned veterans marching forth with elaborately effective
disciplines China substituted mass forces drawn directly from
the populace, as need arose. In some dynasties the system was
regularized in militia form. Of the Han, H. H. Dubs writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chinese armies were largely militia. Everyone was compelled to
serve three years in the army or in forced labor; at the northern border,
the whole male population had constantly to be ready to repel Hun
forays. Hence all males seem to have been able to fight and to be
required to do so. When the Emperor Wu [ca. 120 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>] wanted armies
and none would volunteer, he merely had his officials sentence criminals
to army service&mdash;and thus secured armies which seemed to be able to
fight as successfully as his previous armies. Universal military conscription
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_84" title="pg 84"> </a>
plus a registration of all able-bodied males seems to have been
the Han method.<sup><a href="#fn50" id="r50">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The common people had crossbows for shooting birds or pronged
hoes for digging which were efficient even in fighting standing
armies; they were also frequently in possession of weapons
because they were called up as militia against barbarians.
Underlying such military conditions, with their highly important
political consequences, there were several surprisingly concrete
and simple mechanical considerations. The charioteers had
come to an end partly because the chariots were drawn by horses
yoked in such a fashion that when the horses pulled hard, they
often choked themselves. Other factors are suggested by Dubs:</p>

<blockquote><p>By the time that horses became plentiful, so that cavalry was
employed, the crossbow had reached such a state of development that
cavalry was shown to be inferior to infantry with crossbows. The
medieval European crossbow was hampered by the mechanical weakness
of its trigger mechanism&mdash;the crossbow was likely to be discharged
prematurely by a jar; the Chinese Han crossbow had no such defect
and was a powerful weapon. A group of crossbowmen with others in
the rear to string crossbows and others to bring cocked bows to the
marksmen in the front rank, could shoot down cavalry before they could
come near enough to discharge the lighter bows cavalry necessarily
carried. Cocked crossbows could be carried around safely and fired
when needed. A bolt from a powerful crossbow could pierce any armor.
Hence the strong-backed peasant with a crossbow had an advantage over
the noble no matter how well the noble was armed or how good horses
the latter possessed. The only advantage retained by the noble was
that of leadership&mdash;tactical skill and command of large bodies of
infantry. Cavalry became useful for scouting and pursuit chiefly.<sup><a href="#fn51" id="r51">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The character of military techniques caused Chinese politics to
be qualified by rebellion or the fear of rebellion. The difference
between a mob and an army became slight. In times of poor
government there were rebellions almost yearly. Insurrectionary
forces gained momentum overnight; from era to era huge mobs,
tens and hundreds of thousands strong, swept away governmental
armies and erased corrupt or oppressive dynasties. The
process may be described as popular unrest made effective with
arms, which professional armies could not resist. The low place
of the soldier in society prevented men of genius from organizing
a dominant military caste; the professional armies were insufficient
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_85" title="pg 85"> </a>
to make military government effective. By a crude and
brutal democracy of mob and murder the populace of China
could destroy dynasties and governments whenever economic,
social, or political conditions veered too far beyond the limits
of the tolerable.</p>

<p>Trained fighters there were, but they had the function of
frontier defense; when civil war broke out behind them, the
imperial governments frequently called back the frontier forces
together with the barbarians they had been fighting. At least
two great dynasties, the T'ang and the Ming, were destroyed
because they used the nomads of the northern wilds in order
to put down domestic insurrections. Light cavalry supplemented
enormous bodies of infantry. In fact, the Chinese were put down
by foreign conquerors only when the foreigners had Chinese
allies, or when a campaign of terror had broken the spirit of
popular resistance. Chinese warfare showed the disadvantages
as well as the advantages of being carried on by what were in
effect militia forces. The cruelty was personal and direct, and
not covered with fine disclaimers; restraint of armed forces was
the distinguished exception rather than the rule. The line
between soldier and peasant was one which could be crossed
easily, and the line between soldiery and banditry a matter of
intention. At its best, military technique was honest and
robustly egalitarian; at its worst it led to abuse of force such as
lynching, robbery, and fanatical turbulence. The formal
records of Chinese dynasties show the use of trained armies in
foreign expeditions, in some of which they achieved feats of
military accomplishment which rank with any of world history.
Domestic troops were also employed as guards and ornamental
bodies attached to the throne and other great offices of the
Empire.</p>

<p>The convenience of rebellion was such as to make revolt a
part of the unwritten constitutional practice&mdash;that broad ideological
framework upon which the Chinese world rested. It was
sanctioned by the classics. It served as a barometer of popular
opinion. An unsuccessful rebellion, one without the dimmest
chance of success, might well be launched by intelligent and
patriotic men because its very appearance could prompt the
government to reform. In the words of one of the earliest
Western writers on the subject:</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_86" title="pg 86"> </a></p>

<blockquote><p>A military and police is maintained sufficient to crush merely factious
risings, but totally inadequate, both in numbers and in nature, to put
down a disgusted and indignant people. But though no despotism,
this same government is in form and machinery a pure autocracy. In
his district the magistrate is absolute; in his province, the governor;
in the empire, the Emperor. The Chinese people have no right of
legislation, they have no right of self-taxation, they have not the power
of voting out their rulers or of limiting or stopping supplies. <em>They have
therefore the right of rebellion.</em> Rebellion is in China the old, often
exercised, legitimate, and constitutional means of stopping arbitrary
and vicious legislation and administration.<sup><a href="#fn52" id="r52">9</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Thomas Taylor Meadows, the author just quoted, also noted
that "of all nations that have attained a certain degree of civilization,
the Chinese are the least revolutionary and the most
rebellious."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="r53">10</a></sup> <em>Revolution</em> is a word broad enough to include
principles; <em>rebellion</em>, more narrowly, suggests action against men.
The same tight, enduring system of ideological control served
to restrain the Chinese in their thinking even when they had the
material power sufficient to shake off their past and build Utopia
in its place. Rebels themselves obeyed the unwritten precepts.
The triumph of the civilians was complete: with infantry prevailing
on the battlefield, the peasants were the strongest; and with
the total population saturated in compelling, uniform ideas of
right and wrong, appropriate and inappropriate, the scholars had
only to await the establishment of administration to assume the
leadership. Against malgovernment, the populace retained the
power of rebellion. Against misrule, the scholars held the power
which came to them as interpreters of a vast and persuasive code
of tradition. Whereas Western courts, citing the past, can
negate the acts of the executive or legislative by interpretation
or annulment, the Chinese scholars would do the same not merely
for law, but for manners, morals, thoughts, and social activities
as well. The great peasant armies, though able to destroy
military dictatorship, were by their very nature too loosely
organized to establish it.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Military Organization of the Manchu Dynasty</a></em></p>

<p>Although the Manchus, who conquered China in the first half
of the seventeenth century and ruled it until the opening of the
twentieth, did not profoundly modify Chinese culture, they
affected the military scheme. The general outline of Chinese
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_87" title="pg 87"> </a>
war and its place in society remained largely the same; but there
were two innovations: the establishment of a warrior caste and
the introduction of military techniques from the West.</p>

<p>The Manchus were a non-Chinese people living in the northeastern
peripheral zone of Chinese civilization. They had
adopted the Chinese form of empire and bureaucracy in their
capital at Mukden in the early seventeenth century, before
advancing toward China proper. Invited by the Chinese to
lend their aid in a civil war, the Manchus found themselves
excelling in effectiveness and leadership, which soon led them
to conquer the whole country. The numerical disproportion
between Chinese and Manchus was such that the conquerors
would never have taken over the Empire and founded a new
dynasty (the Ch'ing) had they not been assisted by large numbers
of Chinese. On the other hand, the spectacular terrorism
of the Manchu cavalry was a potent weapon, and the Manchus
did not feel that they owed their throne entirely to the Chinese.
They were in the anomalous position of half-conquerors, a people
coming into China partly as aliens and partly as the new leaders
of the Chinese. At the very beginning of their rule (commonly
dated 1644) they had to decide on a policy to determine their
relations with the Chinese: Should they allow their people to
mingle with and disappear into the vast Chinese masses, or
should they attempt a policy of racial separateness to keep their
blood clear of Chinese dilution? Underlying this question there
was the even more practical one: Should the Manchus rule
China simply as another imperial house, or should they attempt
to maintain their status as a racially separate caste of conquerors?</p>

<p>There is a Chinese legend which tells of a high minister of state,
a Chinese in the service of the Manchu conquerors, who saw no
remedy from the oppression of China in his own generation, but
who nevertheless worked with craftily concealed patriotism to
sow the undoing of the house of the Ch'ing. He recommended
to the Manchus that they keep their fighting men from demoralization
by ordaining that no Manchu warrior should enter any
trade or profession but those of warfare and public administration,
and that they should guard the ancient heritage of their
valiant blood by making miscegenation a crime. Thus he
schemed to stiffen the Manchu monarchy in a position of
unbounded arrogance, so that a few generations of peace would
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_88" title="pg 88"> </a>
find its armies sloven, atrophied, and useless, and its people still
alien to the Chinese. With neither military power to overawe
the masses nor popular affection to uphold their foreign-rooted
dynasty, they were bound to go down; all this, the legend tells,
the Chinese adviser who lived and died with high Manchu honors
clearly foresaw. Actually the Manchus did move in such a
direction, and with the prophesied results.</p>

<p>They had conquered China with their own tribal-military
system intact, organized into units termed <em>banners</em>. Unable to
hold the country by their own force alone and, after putting
down serious rebellions, unwilling to depend on the Chinese,
they arranged a method of dual garrisoning. A Manchu military
hierarchy paralleled the Chinese bureaucracy throughout the
Empire, and Manchu bannermen were placed in every city of
strategic importance. The Manchu garrisons were made up of
men destined to arms, men who were the descendants of the
wild horsemen of the northeastern plains, but who soon became
tragic and useless idlers. Forbidden entrance into the vast and
vital civilian society of the Chinese, by a decree of their own
kinsman on the throne, they spent generation after generation in
profound peace, forgetting war and losing their self-respect as
warriors. Whatever the reason, they did not engage in practices
such as the extended hunts, amounting in fact to great army
maneuvers, by which Kublai Khan kept his Mongol troops hard
and ready for war. An English writer, familiar with the state
of the Manchu garrisons in their last years, thus described them:</p>

<blockquote><p>But, unhappily, the inactive bannermen, both at Peking and in the
provinces, had towards the end degenerated into idle, flabby, and too
often opium-smoking parasites; they had long neglected to keep up their
archery, which in any case had become useless in these days of magazine
rifles, though it might have nourished a wholesome muscular habit of
body if persisted in.... In the provinces these degenerate Manchus
were often, practically, honourable prisoners, rigidly confined within
the limits of the city walls, in the midst of a semi-hostile population
speaking a dialect which the bannermen ... had to learn, ... if they
wished even to buy a cabbage in the streets; and the Tartar General,
who nominally outranked even the Chinese Viceroy, was really often a
self-indulgent, ignorant incompetent.<sup><a href="#fn54" id="r54">11</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Politically, the Chinese found themselves face to face with a
foreign group imbued with an arrogant racial pride and determined
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" title="pg 89"> </a>
to maintain a separate existence. The Manchus did not
bend to the superior numbers of the Chinese, nor yield to the
attractions of Chinese culture. They maintained the Manchu
language at the innermost citadel of Chinese civilization&mdash;the
Forbidden City at Peking&mdash;and stamped their West Asiatic
script on the money of the Empire. They worked out schemes
by which the Manchus would retain a majority in the highest
offices of the Empire, on the sole ground of race. Elementary
rationalizations of two opposing racial attitudes were the result.
The Manchu policy fortified and brought back from the past the
racial pride of the Chinese. They were not merely the civilized
heart of humanity; they were, civilization or no civilization,
bound together by blood. If the Manchu garrisons served no
other purpose, the presence of alien troops in the cities taught the
Chinese the first lessons of resentment; it prepared them for the
vigorous racial-nationalist appeal which the Nationalists were
to put forth.</p>

<p>Governmentally, the effect of Manchu dual government was to
force the Chinese to an increased consciousness of the implied
presuppositions of their social and political system. The use of
the garrisons constituted one of the four main causes of Manchu
decline; the second cause was the violation of the strict merit
system by racial preference in the bureaucracy; the other two
were failure to maintain domestic tranquillity, and corruption in
the hierarchy of scholar-officials.<sup><a href="#fn55" id="r55">12</a></sup> Manchu rule by military
power was unrealistic and a political affront. Their army of
permanent occupation committed slow suicide in idleness and at
the same time kept the Manchu dynasty from nativizing itself
so that the Chinese might think of it as Chinese. Their creation
of a hierarchy of bannermen, paralleling the older Chinese
civilian institutions, brought to the surface of thought those
prejudices and assumptions which had guided and controlled
Chinese destiny for centuries. Government and society had
been one to such a degree that the special features of a universal
control did not require legalization or sharp tracing. The
Manchus removed government from the rest of society by
staining it with militarism and racial preference; it became
ominously disparate and a conspicuous target for examination
and consideration.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Manchu rule
brought into a sharper focus the largely unformulated constitutional
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_90" title="pg 90"> </a>
theory which had underlain the Chinese imperial
society for nearly twenty centuries. With the sharper demarcation
of rulers and ruled, the Manchus had to make frequent and
overt use of legal authority over the ideology. The Chinese
read of the sanction of rebellion in their own classics; they could
turn to their histories for a description of the ignoble origins
of their present masters. The dynasty turned therefore to
literary censorship and ordered extensive excisions from all
writings scholarly, artistic, or other, which might weaken the
prestige of their house.<sup><a href="#fn56" id="r56">13</a></sup> They ordained a most rigid and
dogmatic interpretation of the classics so as to suit their purposes.
This the Chinese met with sharp criticism. The literary struggle
did much to weaken the scholastic class and to deprive the
Manchus of academic supporters. At the same time it deprived
the peasant Chinese of their natural leaders, with the consequence
that secret and half-literate political associations faced an
arbitrary government military in character. The old Chinese
system remained, but it became more and more of a form with
every generation. The theory of moral agency and ideological
control was defamed by the very presence of the barbarian
garrisons. The barbarians themselves weakened so much that in
the later days of the Manchu Empire the military occupation
became a myth instead of being a political fact. For the time
being, however, Manchu military organization acted as a force-displaying
agency until the scholars and the less favored classes
of society were able to combine in a revolution.</p>

<p>Pacific government, government by moral agency, derives its
greatest powers from assent and agreement; it thrives on symbolization
and is never necessarily dependent upon the display
of outright force. Government by force, on the other hand,
remains effective almost in proportion to the exercise and vigor
of that force; stereotyped and ritualized, it is essentially weak.
Purely ceremonial administration and offices may be a burden
on the body politic, yet their dignity may make up for their
lack of efficiency. But an army that cannot fight is an object of
ridicule, and its very presence a challenge to the resources of
intelligence.</p>

<p>The Manchu garrisons in the key cities were under the command
of Manchu military officers, whom Europeans dubbed with
the picturesque title of <em>Tartar Generals</em>. The garrisons were
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_91" title="pg 91"> </a>
made up of three racial elements: Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese.
The Chinese in the banner armies were the descendants of
soldiers in the renegade Han army (<em>han ch&uuml;n</em>), the Chinese section
of the Manchu-Mongol-Chinese formations which conquered
China for the Manchus in the seventeenth century. The
military organization seems to have been a simplified copy of
civilian bureaucracy, with examiners, censors, and other familiar
devices of Chinese government appearing in quasi-military form.
The principle of merit was violated, however, in that certain
categories of men claimed special rank by hereditary right.<sup><a href="#fn57" id="r57">14</a></sup>
It was also possible for some of the bannermen to transfer
between the civilian and the military branches of the government.</p>

<p>In the early nineteenth century the <em>han ch&uuml;n</em> possessed considerable
artillery. There was a separate navy, comprising more
than two thousand war vessels equipped from a score of dockyards.
Even then, Chinese military technology was markedly
inferior to European; the Chinese navy was no match even for
Europe's wooden warships. When ironclads entered Far
Eastern waters and breech-loading cannon were employed, the
difference made Chinese naval and artillery establishments almost
antiquarian in nature. With most of the banner forces of the
Empire kept at Peking and the rest scattered over the country
in the great cities, the Manchu force was widely diffused. In
practice their armies hardly exceeded a quarter of a million men;
whatever the exact total, the military were outnumbered far
over a thousand to one by the Chinese, in the realm which the
Manchus supposedly held by conquest.</p>

<p>The effective army in the later years of the Ch'ing dynasty
was formed for the most part of the Green Standard (<em>l&uuml; ying</em>),
provincial regulars, and the vast hordes of irregulars (<em>yung</em>, or
"braves") who have traditionally done the greater share of the
fighting in Chinese history. The Green Standard troops appear
to have suffered, although to a lesser degree, from the long peace
which ruined the banner armies, but their use in major police
enterprises and troubles with primitive peoples kept them from
the utter demoralization of the banners. The common practice
under the Ch'ing was to recruit the local toughs, to appoint their
leaders as probationary officers, and to use such emergency
armies for real and immediate fighting. Although the Manchu
dynasty had no system of organized reserves and little machinery
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_92" title="pg 92"> </a>
for rapid mobilization, they were thus nevertheless able to swell
their armies to astonishing numbers in a very short while.
American military commentators said in 1900 that the peacetime
size of the Chinese imperial army was about three hundred
thousand men and its wartime strength about one million&mdash;minute
figures for China's reserve of man power&mdash;and added:</p>

<blockquote><p>The total strength of the standing army of China can not be exactly
ascertained, and if a statement of the number of men belonging to it
could be given, it would be of little value, as many of the men who are
carried on the rolls are neither armed nor equipped, and a great number
of them are not even performing military service, but are following their
usual vocations.<sup><a href="#fn58" id="r58">15</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>This military regime bears the air of a vast preparation for
some foreseen but remote emergency. The Manchus themselves
seemed to sleep; armies drowsed through the centuries, weapons
rusting, tactics forgotten in the mimicry of parade, while all
about them the factual potency of military power passed to the
Chinese. Even the Europeans at first shared the illusion of
great although latent military power behind the Manchu throne.
The easy defeat of the Manchu Chinese forces in the wars with
England and France in the early and middle nineteenth century
led writers such as Thomas De Quincey to cry out against the
great fraud of Asia&mdash;the sleeping Manchu giant, who was not
sleeping but dead.</p>

<p>The T'ai-p'ing rebellion<sup><a href="#fn59" id="r59">16</a></sup> lasting from 1849 to 1865 provided
an actual test of military power in the Manchu Empire, and
demonstrated two remarkable new facts. First, the real forces
were no longer the regular troops, whether banner or Green
Standard, but the militia which might be organized and trained
for immediate results by robust civilians like the viceroys Li
Hung-chang and Ts&ecirc;ng Kuo-fan.<sup><a href="#fn60" id="r60">17</a></sup> Second, the military
technique of the Far East was obsolete; even a little Western
equipment, leadership, and training made any Chinese army
immediately more effective. The consequences were contradictory.
If the military regime of the Manchus existed only in a
formal sense, and actual power had passed to the Chinese masses,
who had only to await a leadership to exhibit their power, then
force had failed and government by moral agency would again be
the need of the epoch. At the same time, the introduction of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_93" title="pg 93"> </a>
Western technique showed the possibility of a new regime of
force, another opportunity for a minority to overwhelm the vast
majority by sheer technical military effectiveness, and government
by moral agency could not be sufficient. The center
of military gravity would not simply pass to the group possessing
the largest army. A new form of government, making intelligent
use of modern weapons, was called for.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly China was and is too large to be governed by
mere military occupation&mdash;unless forces far larger than any
which have heretofore operated in the Far East are employed.
The very garrisoning of the country would absorb tremendous
armies. At the same time, military force is sufficient to overawe
and intimidate civilians in any given area, since the man with a
rifle is superior to the man with the crossbow or spear. Conceivably,
however, a rhythm may originate between the progress
in introducing new weapons and the progress of the populace in
learning new means of counteraction. In 1860 the British and
French entered Peking and later burned the Summer Palace
of the Manchu emperors as a lesson to the imperial government.
The expedition, casual when measured by Western standards,
showed that the Manchu bannermen and Chinese levies were
equally powerless before the intrusion of a more advanced skill
in warfare. As soon as peace was declared the Chinese began
organizing some of their metropolitan forces after the Western
manner, obtaining foreign instructors to put them through the
Western manual of arms.</p>

<p>At the same time that the Manchu court was learning to its
discomfort the importance of Western warfare, it was calling
Westerners to its aid in putting down the T'ai-p'ings. The
Manchus assembled a nineteenth century navy including steam
vessels from British and other sources, which broke up without
having accomplished much. With land forces there was much
greater success; an American, Frederick Townsend Ward, and
an Englishman, Major Charles George ("Chinese") Gordon,
organized a small body of imperial regular troops along Western
lines and with Western officers. This force was given the
honorific title of "Ever Victorious Army" by the court, and
together with the militia organized by Ts&ecirc;ng Kuo-fan and
Li Hung-chang suppressed the T'ai-p'ing rebellion after the
banner and Green Standard armies had failed.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_94" title="pg 94"> </a></p>

<p>The ensuing thirty years (1865-1895) witnessed the slow
decline in Manchu foreign policy and military development and a
gradual crumbling of Chinese society at large. Revolutionaries
such as Sun Yat-sen received their first baptism of Westernization
in the 1870's and 1880's, and foreign trade rose by great leaps.
Occasionally the Empire's military regime seemed to rally.
Between 1883 and 1885 the Chinese forces fighting the French
in Indo-China were equipped with Mannlicher rifles far more
up-to-date than the weapons of their enemies. In the preceding
decade the Chinese destroyed a Mohammedan state set up in
Chinese Turkestan in defiance of their suzerainty, and overawed
the Russians into evacuating an area along the Ili seized under
the pretence of maintaining order. The lack of coordination
between the different agencies of government was as much to
blame for China's weakness as were the specific defects of the
central departments. When the army was winning, the diplomatic
agencies yielded; when the army was unprepared, the
diplomatic agencies, by some ill-timed impertinence, gave aliens
the pretext for hostilities.</p>

<p>The first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) offered another test.
Hitherto, the armed conflicts with Europeans, even including the
entry of Westerners into Peking in 1860, had seemed remote from
the actual problem of military power in China. The Europeans
might possibly withdraw and leave the Empire in peace. But
incalculable danger would arise to Chinese prestige should the
<em>wo</em>, the sea dwarfs, defeat the Chinese and eat more deeply into
the mainland. Chinese began to realize that in this war their
status was at stake, not only in the dimly perceived wide universe
of the Westerners but also in that of the Far East in which
they had long held such comfortable hegemony. They entered
the war relatively well equipped, so that even outside observers
were doubtful of the outcome of the struggle. No one was more
amazed than the Chinese themselves when they were whipped
as no modern nation has been whipped, routed ignominiously in a
sequence of slaughters, and ultimately forced to make important
territorial and financial concessions to the Japanese.</p>

<p>This catastrophe was followed by a series of reforms, some
designed to enable China to meet the West on its own ground.
In January, 1896, a turning point was reached with the appointment
of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai to command the one efficient brigade
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_95" title="pg 95"> </a>
assembled in the course of the war.<sup><a href="#fn61" id="r61">18</a></sup> Y&uuml;an was to find in
modern arms the career which led to his dictatorship after the fall
of the Empire, and was to perform notable work as a military
and administrative reformer, although of restricted value. He
joined the reactionaries and brought to an end the Hundred
Days of Reform of 1898, a movement generated by the initiative
of the idealistic young Emperor Kuang Hs&uuml;, who sought to
direct China into the course already taken by Japan&mdash;modernization
within the imperial system. In 1900 there occurred the wild
upheaval of the Boxers. It began as a native racial uprising
against the Manchus, but was deflected by the Manchus into the
support of the court and hostility against the Western intruders.
During the Boxer movement part of the fighting against the
Westerners was done by regular banner and Green Standard
troops, but the greater part by bands of desperadoes and fanatics.
The imperial army suffered in the chaos following the international
occupation of Peking.</p>

<p>Under the name of the <em>Wu Wei Ch&uuml;n</em> the first large-scale
attempt was made to modernize the Chinese armed forces.
After the military and naval experiments of the 1860's and later
decades, this enterprise evoked great hopes. The new army
was inaugurated in 1895 with foreign instruction and foreign
arms. In 1901 one division was made the core of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai's
new modern force. Rodney Gilbert, a British publicist, has
summarized the military changes down to the end of the Manchu
dynasty as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 1901 the Yangtze Viceroys submitted a memorial to the
Throne suggesting among other things the disbandment of the useless
<em>L&uuml; Ying</em> [Armies of the Green Standard], the employment of the Bannermen,
almost as useless, in service other than military, and the creation
of a modern army. This brought forth an Imperial decree ordering
reorganization of the army, of which Yuan Shih-kai, then Viceroy of
Chihli, took advantage to build up six new divisions, four of which were
transferred to the Ministry of War in 1906. This was the real beginning
of the <em>Lu Chun</em>, the Chinese National Army. In January, 1905, a
comprehensive scheme was outlined designed to give China an army of
36 Divisions or 360,000 men, by the year 1911. Three years after
this decision was made there were about 60,000 men, with 360 guns, in
the North, and 40,000 men, with 174 guns, in the South. The army
was developing along sound lines when Yuan Shih-kai was removed
from office in 1908 after the death of his great patroness the Empress
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_96" title="pg 96"> </a>
Dowager, and the direction of military, as well as other affairs, fell into
the hands of the Manchu princes, whose mismanagement contributed
much to the downfall of their dynasty three years later.<sup><a href="#fn62" id="r62">19</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The beginning, although auspicious, did not mean that even
the model sections of the modernized forces were comparable to
those of other lands. The confusion of weapons was already
evident. A member of the United States General Staff wrote
in 1910:</p>

<blockquote><p>To arm these masses China has been obliged to use weapons that are
considered somewhat out of date. There are four types of rifles, mostly
Mausers and Japanese Murata rifles of old pattern. They are, however,
breech-loading, small-caliber weapons, not to be despised, even if they
do not reach the ideal which some nations set. In fact they are the
weapons which have been used in the great wars of most recent date.</p>

<p>It is so also with the artillery where even a greater difference of types
is to be observed. This is, undoubtedly, a serious drawback, owing, of
course, to the great difficulty of providing ammunition.<sup><a href="#fn63" id="r63">20</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>It was during this period, from the decisive defeat of the
dynasty by Japan in 1895 to the Republican Revolution of 1911-1912,
that the Chinese revolutionaries most eagerly studied
military manuals and sought to purchase Western arms to offset
the great advantages gained by the modernized portions of the
imperial army. Sun Yat-sen became almost as much a military
authority as he was a political philosopher and leader; his chief
military follower, General Huang Hsing, performed for the
revolutionaries the services rendered for the regime by Y&uuml;an
Shih-k'ai. On both sides there was the anxiety to master the
mysteries of twentieth century warfare. The World War had
not yet begun, nor had the staggering burdens of modern armament
become evident. Great as were the improvements in
fighting, prewar military organization seemed still primarily a
matter of well-equipped infantry, properly led, properly drilled,
and supported by adequate artillery and other auxiliary services.
Wireless, gas, airplanes, tanks, submarines, torpedo launches,
and mechanized or aerialized infantry were little more than a
matter of speculation. The proportions of present-day military
budgets no one could foresee.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_97" title="pg 97"> </a></p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Army and the Republican Revolution</a></em></p>

<p>The Republican Revolution of 1911-1912 was the last overt
act in the collapse of the ideologically maintained social system;
it brought armies into violently free play in the support of
movements toward re-formation of the ideology and articulation
and control of the society. On October 10, 1911, the troops of
the Wuch'ang garrison rose in mutiny and sided with the revolution.
A series of uprisings engineered by military and agitational
leaders followed, province by province, all directed against the
imperial power in the North. The use of violence in Chinese
politics served to accentuate a condition which had affected
China even in the earliest historic times&mdash;the unresolved contradictions
between the North and the South. Differences of
race, spoken language, and economy produced fundamental
cleavages accentuated by temperament. Traditionally the
North was more conservative and solidaristic, the South more
rebellious and enterprising. Sun Yat-sen was a Southerner;
militarism reached its sharpest effectiveness in the North.</p>

<p>Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai, who had proved himself the evil genius of
Emperor Kuang Hs&uuml; by betraying the monarch's reforms of 1898,
was called to the aid of the Manchus only to betray them to the
Republic; he then served the Republic with the intention of
seizing complete power for himself. The Republicans set up
their regime in Nanking on January 1, 1912, with Sun Yat-sen
as president. They established contact with Y&uuml;an, who acted
in the triple capacity of negotiator for the Manchus, representative
of the modernized armies of the North (which were his), and
leader in his own right and in his own interest. The Republicans
realized that Y&uuml;an could not be dispossessed&mdash;indeed, it is fairly
certain that he could have upheld the throne had he so wished.
Their power was indefinite, and as Chinese they preferred compromise
and order to ideals pushed to the bitter end. In the
middle of February they yielded to Y&uuml;an, and Sun surrendered
to him the presidency as a reward for his allegiance to the
Republic. Y&uuml;an, for the Manchus, secured a settlement by
which the Forbidden City (the residence of the emperor in
Peking) was made into a second Vatican City; the emperor was
allowed his formal and ritual titles (a status remarkably like
that of the Pope) and a very substantial stipend. For the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_98" title="pg 98"> </a>
Northern armies and himself Y&uuml;an obtained actual power over
the country. A civilian, but a soldier as well, Y&uuml;an rose by
both intrigue and the implied threat of force.</p>

<p>The Republic was launched by valedictory imperial edicts
ordering the imperial officials throughout the realm to obey
Y&uuml;an and the new form of government; by Republicans nominally
headed by their greatest and coldest antagonist; and by a soldier
of higher professional standing in the Western sense than any
Chinese leader for centuries past undertaking the task of keeping
order and ushering China through drastic reconstruction. For
a few halcyon months it seemed as though the Republic might
grow into reality from under the aegis of military dictatorship.<sup><a href="#fn64" id="r64">21</a></sup>
But soon it became apparent that the revolution was not a
transfer of power and renovation of order but the dissolution of
power and the erasure of order. What was left was ideological
uncertainty, social turmoil, economic disorganization&mdash;with
politics reduced to mere pageantry, and the armies, ominously
growing under the care of President Y&uuml;an, maintaining what
little order was left to maintain. In 1913 the Nationalist-Republicans
rebelled in the Yangtze valley and were crushed by
the armies of the government of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>From the military rule of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai there emerged an
army system which was to bring China to almost complete
political ruin in the decade after Y&uuml;an's death. Although he
organized a model regiment as a sample of what could be done
in China, inflation of numbers and deterioration of morale and
<em>mat&eacute;riel</em> were the most obvious symptoms of the new role of
the army&mdash;a role much more concerned with problems of domestic
intrigue than with defense against the outsiders. For an army
of national defense, high technical excellence and a commensurate
smallness of numbers are desirable features; for an army of
dictatorship or occupation, inferior equipment, poor supplies, and
inefficient training are all trifling handicaps in comparison with
the advantage of vast numbers which can be used to garrison
large sections of the realm and meet the threat of civil war. The
very shift from empire to republic involved the enlistment of
additional thousands of revolutionary fighters; once in the army,
they were hard to dislodge. The personal military interests of
Y&uuml;an led him to expand the army, and his political ambitions
nourished the thought that the country would be secure beneath
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_99" title="pg 99"> </a>
him only through the medium of an extensive garrison system.
Finally, there was a far-reaching shift in the Chinese social
pyramid. Men of intelligence and of education flocked to the
army, and Japan's military schools were crowded with young
Chinese who saw in war their easiest avenue to fortune or to the
service of their country.</p>

<p>A reconstituted army, soldiers who could command greater
respect than ever before, numerical extension and qualitative
deterioration of the national armed forces&mdash;these were the more
patent military changes under the Republic. To them must be
added the factors fusing the elements into a system that was to
bring immediate fortune and ultimate ruin to practically all who
ventured into its operations. Many of the provinces which
turned to the cause of the revolutionaries in 1911 and 1912
became gradually militarized. When the Manchus were gone,
the old distinction between the Tartar General and the civilian
viceroy had lost its purpose; the new provincial executives combined
both military and governmental powers. Provincial
jealousies and the growing disorder favored a strong factual
autonomy for the various provinces, even though there was no
technical claim of provincial independence and very little even
of confederation. The first Republic was in name a centralized
parliamentary-presidential state with quasi-federal features; in
fact it was the combination of an impotent, headless imperial
bureaucracy and a presidential military dictatorship possessing
physically limited and indefinable authority over a large group
of provinces. Between China and the accomplishment of
regular and orderly republican government there stood ignorance,
turmoil, poverty, reaction, and despair. Between Y&uuml;an's
regime and the <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> system there stood only Y&uuml;an's might.</p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> V</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">CAUSES</a></h2>


<p>Y&uuml;an's closing years might have resembled Napoleon's rise
from the position of First Consul to that of emperor, had he not
been checked at the very last moment by armed uprisings and
expressions of deep popular contempt. Even so, he retained
control of the country.<sup><a href="#fn65" id="r65">1</a></sup> The humiliation of his defeat lacked
even dramatic compensations, and he died in June, 1916, of
disease, poison, or chagrin. With his death the Republic had a
chance to stand by itself, but it could not.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Age of the War Lords</a></em></p>

<p>Y&uuml;an had fastened the symbols of old on the scaffolding of a
new order. With his death the momentum of administrative
routine retained from the Manchu dynasty was lost; the Republican
government in Peking degenerated from impotence to
comedy. The process called government began to nauseate
patriotic Chinese and foreigners alike; few were able to take a
long view, to maintain their courage, and to keep on fighting
against disgusting and disheartening realities. With the decomposition
of the central government&mdash;except the modern bureaucracies
such as posts and customs, which were kept intact by
their foreign personnel and their special international status&mdash;the
armies, though divided provincially, stepped into positions of
unprecedented authority. There was a veritable epidemic of
monarchical ambition, greed, and willfulness among the provincial
military commanders; many Chinese expected a new
Y&uuml;an to emerge from that group and become the "strong man
of China." With such a stage to strut on, it is not surprising
that the Chinese military lost constructive vision. A sober
nucleus of idealistically hard-headed, patriotic men, each a
George Washington, might have used military power to reunite
the country, but order could not be expected to emerge from the
unsystematized competition of armed forces.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_103" title="pg 103"> </a></p>

<p>Three broader factors affected the ascendancy of war lords,
in addition to obvious motives and interests. The ideological
ruin was bad enough; the consequent social disorder crippled
China. But the armies now came to provide a refuge for the
unemployed and dispossessed. A second factor, the mechanical
mobilization of military forces through the railways, made warfare
more expensive and ruinous than it would have been with
the slow-moving infantry of the past. Thirdly, the war lords
gave physical embodiment to the ideological and social disunity
of China, inviting the constant intervention of the Western
powers and of Japan in Chinese affairs.</p>

<p>Individually the war lords warrant no special attention.
There was Chang Tso-lin in Manchuria; Tuan Chi-jui and Ts'ao
Kun in North China; Yen Hsi-shan ("The Model Governor")
and, to the west of him, F&ecirc;ng Y&uuml;-hsiang ("The Christian
General"); Chang Chung-chang in Shantung, significant more
for his brutality than for his political and military position;
the quaint, conservative scholar Wu P'ei-fu, in the Yangtze
valley, minor figures in the South and West. It was not the
generals who were important, but militarism.</p>

<p>Militarism machine-gunned the Confucian ethics out of
politics; it taxed the land into ruin; it laid China wide open to
imperialistic thrusts, and&mdash;by the same act&mdash;made her a poor
market. Militarism built roads when they were strategically
required, established a few railways and spoiled more, modernized
China, but did so in the costliest way of all. Only in the
intellectual world was military domination not outright destruction.
The generals and their staffs were surprisingly ignorant of
the power of ideas, ineffectual in their censorship, oblivious to
the great leverage of undercover agitation. Trusting arms,
they failed to see that the only opposition able to destroy them
was not military but mental.</p>

<p>While the soldiery stirred the country with murder and
oppression, their system progressed steadily toward self-destruction.
Two great pressures forced constant further expansion of
the armies. The first is obvious: military rivalry. The second
was the growing abuse of army organization as a means of unemployment
relief. Military taxation drove the peasants off the
land, whereupon they had no recourse but to become bandits or
soldiers. If they were bandits, consolidation under a chieftain
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_104" title="pg 104"> </a>
transformed them into military irregulars and induced some
ambitious general to include them in his forces. If they were
soldiers, the bandit stage remained in reach. In either case,
they added to the burden falling upon their commander, which
in turn led to still greater impoverishment of the peasants, a
further increase of dispossessed men, bandits, and soldiers.
With the widening circulation of arms, Western guns and fighting
methods became less and less a secret of small groups capable of
establishing a firm military oligarchy and more and more the
property of a cross section of the Chinese masses.</p>

<p>From an estimated total of 1,369,880 in 1921,<sup><a href="#fn66" id="r66">2</a></sup> the number of
men under arms rose to a figure estimated to be between 1,883,300
and 1,933,300 five years later.<sup><a href="#fn67" id="r67">3</a></sup> This increase occurred in one
of the poorest countries of the world, despite conditions of
extreme misery:</p>

<blockquote><p>Recruiting goes on incessantly in every town in North China where
there is a garrison. There are no statistics available, but it is known
that the death rate from disease is very high because, even in garrison,
sanitary precautions are crude and the medical service is inefficient and
inadequate. In battle the care of the wounded is barbarously primitive,
even in the best units, and death from infected wounds is rather the
rule than the exception; while those who cannot walk from the field to
the nearest hospital more often than not die of exposure or clumsy
handling. One of a Chinese commander's major concerns is filling the
gaps in the ranks, but at the same time these conditions have kept the
proportions of the armies down to a fairly constant figure. Chinese
officers have advanced the theory that if recruiting were everywhere
abandoned, disease, desertions and losses in battle would account for
ten per cent. per annum, so that the armies would automatically cease to
exist in ten years.<sup><a href="#fn68" id="r68">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The use of the railways for military purposes unsettled large
groups of Chinese geographically and caused meetings of extensive
bodies of men from different areas. At first such contacts,
especially under wartime conditions, would only intensify
provincial sentiment and mistrust of strangers, but gradually
this influence began to make for a new national consciousness.
In the meantime, the troops learned the intricacies of modern
transport. A coolie in a peaceful part of Asia might see trains
for years, observing the Westerners riding in them, and remain
impressed by the sight; a Chinese bandit sitting on a freight car
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_105" title="pg 105"> </a>
in a commandeered train would become rapidly familiar with
the fire vehicles.</p>

<p>The role of the militarists with respect to China's international
status was ambiguous. In the first place, the weakness which
they created reduced China to an international pawn. The
discord into which she had fallen allowed for semipartitions&mdash;various
foreign interests backing different war lords&mdash;although
a genuine partition may thereby have been staved off. In China
proper the influence of the Japanese seemed to be behind Chang
Tso-lin and the Northern militarists; the British were regarded
as friendly to Wu P'ei-fu in the Yangtze valley; and the French
achieved something not far from domination in the province
farthest southwest, Y&uuml;nnan. F&ecirc;ng Y&uuml;-hsiang was supposed to
have veered picturesquely for foreign friends between the
Protestant missions and the Bolshevik agents. A miniature
replica of the European balance of power could be played in
China, with outside groups friendly to one or the other war lord.
An agreement between the chief participants in 1919 sought to
prevent the shipping of arms to unauthorized military groups in
China but proved largely ineffectual in the end.</p>

<p>Between 1922 and 1926 there was formed in South China a
nexus of armies which were to provide the military edge to
ideological revolution and establish the followers of Sun Yat-sen
in power. These armies were built up with the assistance of
Russian and German advisers and with American arms which
had been left in Siberia and had fallen into the hands of the
Bolsheviks; the troops were led by new-style Chinese officers
under the leadership of Chiang K'ai-shek. The Whampoa
Academy was the most obvious sign of the new school of military
thought, coming forth as a consequence of the Nationalist-Communist
coalition.<sup><a href="#fn69" id="r69">5</a></sup> Armaments did not differ in any substantial
degree from those of the war lords, but they were more
carefully kept and more skillfully used. The military machine
which arose in the South was better organized, better disciplined,
better led, and better cared for than any army on the Chinese
scene for a decade.</p>

<p>From 1926 to 1927 the ensuing campaign for the Nationalist
conquest of China, as outlined in the principles of Sun Yat-sen,<sup><a href="#fn70" id="r70">6</a></sup>]
drove forward with striking success. The Nationalist troops
everywhere pushed their enemies before them with astonishing
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_106" title="pg 106"> </a>
speed. The explanation is to be found in part in the efficiency
and military honesty of officers and men, but even more in the
nonmilitary factors which fortified the armies and the ideological
weapons which cleared the ground before it. The new armies
not only represented military might; they were also propaganda
machines. To every regiment there was attached a political
staff to keep up the morale of the troops and to win over the
enemy and the civilian population. The troops themselves were
propaganda brigades as well as military units. Literacy in the
armies was made a point of great pride, and certain divisions
made novel reputations for themselves on this ground. The
Nationalists were known by many as the soldiers who did not
harm the people. Without the troops the Nationalists would
never have come to power; but without the supporting sweep of
mass propaganda the Nationalist movement might have gone
on for decades in the form of civilian conspirators fighting against
overwhelming odds or else seeking to make venal mercenaries the
prime instrument for the regeneration of Chinese civilization.</p>

<p>The military revolution of 1926-1927 brought new factors to
the Chinese military scene. It indicated that a point of equilibrium
had been reached between the military and the ideological
modes of control and that it was no longer possible for sheer
force and a minimum of intelligence to hold unchallenged power in
the Chinese society. It was, furthermore, a threefold struggle:
a patriotic and progressive uprising against domestic and foreign
oppression and inefficiency; an agrarian revolt on a grand scale;
and a proletarian uprising on the part of the relatively small but
strategically placed Chinese proletariat. Only in the first of
these aspects did the revolution meet with the approval of most
Chinese&mdash;the victims and not the bearers of arms. Men of all
shades of opinion were able to agree on a policy of attacking the
system of <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>, which offered no planning for the future, no
resurrection of the past, and little public order. The patriotic
troops were enraged by the corruption and inadequacy all about
them and by the fortresses of privilege reared by aliens on their
coasts and in their greatest inland cities.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1926-1927 marked the identification of the
coolie soldier with his own class and of the peasant fighter with
his. The rank and file were given to understand that they were
not fighting in some game beyond their understanding but for
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_107" title="pg 107"> </a>
the security of people like themselves. Under the influence of
the propaganda put forth by the Nationalists and the allied
Communists, an incipient agrarian revolt was fanned into flame
and proletarian uprisings in the cities were made possible for
the first time. Whole sections of the countryside fell into a
condition not far from anarchy as the revolutionary troops led
the people in revolt. After 1927, however, the military forces
developed along two antagonistic lines. The Nationalists,
seizing the political instruments of the revolution but finding its
ideological factors largely beyond their control, began to create
a professionalized army with which to stabilize their regime.
The Communists, and their agrarian allies, standing to the Left
of the newborn Nanking government, were eager to fight on in
the tested informal fashion. In the year of the establishment of
the Nanking government, 1927, the Red Army could still demonstrate
its effectiveness. Shortly afterward the precautionary
arms embargo of the foreign powers, which had prevailed since
1919, was lifted, thereby opening up the means by which Chiang
K'ai-shek could renovate and specialize the armies under his
command.</p>

<p>The break with the war-lord tradition was much more obvious
in the case of the Communists than in the case of the Nationalists.
The Communists, lacking sufficient support to occupy any broad
contiguous territory, fell back on guerrilla fighting of their own.
The Nationalists, strong enough to hold a certain portion of the
area, nevertheless compromised with the existing military system
to seek mastery. For three years after the establishment of the
Nanking government, it remained doubtful whether the whole
government might not subside into inertia and neglect, leaving
Chiang standing alone, distinguished from the other war lords
only by his character.</p>

<p>Late in 1930 and early in 1931 a menacing alliance was organized
between two of the most influential remaining Northern
<em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> and the "liberal" wing of the Nationalists. Operating
from the north, after the proclamation of an insurgent "National
Government" at Peking, the rebels at first seemed to have the
military advantage. Chiang had learned many lessons, however,
and in the most serious fighting which China had seen in years he
broke the force of the Northern offensive. Airplanes appeared as
a threat against the civilian population of Peking, although no
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_108" title="pg 108"> </a>
actual deaths were reported. There were ugly rumors that gas
was being used at the front. Small tanks from England, though
giving a rather poor performance, symbolized a novel trend.
More and better heavy artillery was used than ever before.
Trenches came up to World War standards. The war ended
with the intervention from Manchuria of Chang Hs&uuml;eh-liang,
a strangely progressive and patriotic <em>tuch&uuml;n</em>; but the fighting
had been enough to show that of all the great armed forces in
China the Nationalist armies of Chiang K'ai-shek and the
Nanking government were the most effective.</p>

<p>The rehabilitation of men's thinking had not proceeded far
enough to eliminate the dangers of an overemphasized military
leadership, but the tide had turned. After 1931 the military
situation in China had become subordinate to the problems of
ideology and of government. The chief military factors were
now the governmentalized armies, the guerrilla opposition of the
Communists, and the problem of foreign war.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Age of Air Conquest</a></em></p>

<p>The new military period which replaced the war-lord system
was marked by (1) technical improvement of the armies, especially
in the direction of air power; (2) supplementation of the
armies by the quasi-military power of the civil government, so
that Chinese wars ceased to be a question of armed bands
drifting about the surface of the social system; (3) organization
of the Nationalist armies into national units in fact as well as
name; (4) increasing pressure of the disbandment problem; (5)
development of guerrilla tactics by the Reds and of guerrilla-suppression
tactics by the Nationalists; (6) problems arising
from Japanese conquest, which overwhelmed Manchuria in one
fierce onslaught and harassed China for six years of military
aggressions before breaking forth anew in the catastrophic
surge of 1937-1938.</p>

<p>Aviation was to leap to a sensational place. Aviation and
national civilian government became almost natural complements
of one another. Only by aviation could all parts of the country
be brought under the jurisdiction of Nanking and the geographical
handicaps of China be overcome, and only a national government
could afford the long-term investments in machines and men
necessary to effective air armament. The record of technical
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_109" title="pg 109"> </a>
improvement in the Nationalist armies is clearly symbolized by
the advancement of military aircraft. Military aviation in
China previous to the establishing of the Nanking government
demonstrated the weakness of the preceding regime. As early
as 1909 a French aviator was giving demonstration flights over
Shanghai.<sup><a href="#fn71" id="r71">7</a></sup> The Ch'ing dynasty sought to establish an airplane
factory but met with no success. Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai purchased a few
planes and set up a flying school. The first telling use of planes
in Chinese politics and war occurred, however, with the bombardment
of the imperial palace by a lone aviator in the course
of an attempted monarchical restoration in 1917. In the
period of the war lords there were many isolated efforts to build
up flying services. The most promising of these, undertaken
by the Peking Republic with British assistance after 1920, failed
through neglect, mismanagement, and corruption. As late as
1928 there was no prospect of significant air fighting in China.</p>

<p>By 1931 the Nanking government had built up an air force
of about seventy serviceable planes; a contemporary commentator
observed, "Aeroplanes played a very considerable&mdash;some
would even say a decisive&mdash;part in the civil war of 1930...."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="r72">8</a></sup>
By 1932, when an American aviation mission arrived to help
in the training of a Chinese military air force, the estimates ran
into a total of 125 to 140 commercial and training planes.<sup><a href="#fn73" id="r73">9</a></sup> In
the ensuing five years the Chinese national air force developed
rapidly. It played the leading role in suppressing the Fukien
uprising of 1932-1933 and in driving the Communists into the
Northwest. In 1937 the head of the American aviation mission,
Colonel John Jouett, wrote, "Japan maintains that China has a
thousand planes; my guess would be seven hundred and fifty
of all types. But no one knows...."<sup><a href="#fn74" id="r74">10</a></sup> Other experts would
reduce the figure to one-third or less by the elimination of planes
which would not be of first-class utility in actual combat. The
preparations for foreign hostilities up to 1937 were accompanied
by such a degree of secrecy that definite figures are not available.
For domestic purposes, however, almost every plane would count,
and the cardinal fact remains that domestically the National
Government possesses a monopoly of air power in China. It is
thereby in a better position to make its supreme will formidably
known than was any emperor of any dynasty. The future may
show that Chinese mastery of aircraft is psychologically as
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_110" title="pg 110"> </a>
important as was mastery of the steamship for the Japanese&mdash;a
visible demonstration to an Asiatic people of their own
accomplishments with Western technology.</p>

<p>As for other improvements of the armies, only three factors
need be mentioned. The armies were consolidated generally,
and with their better status&mdash;in literacy, pay, means of subsistence,
and regularity of control&mdash;there came a realization that
the military force was the creature of the national state. The
Chinese nation was taking form as an ideological and social
entity of sufficient strength to command the direct allegiance of
fighting men. A new respect arose for the officers and men of the
armies. Under Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai the armies had been able to
evolve a respectability of their own making; under Chiang
K'ai-shek this respectability began to be accepted at its face
value by the rest of the society, so that a pilot was not only
admired by the crowd but was recognized as an expert among
experts, even in literary and civil-minded circles. Secondly,
the armies affected the nation by road construction. In the
course of the Nationalist-Communist wars of 1927-1937 the
Nationalists built thousands of miles of highway in order to
make full use of their new mobility gained from machine power.
The military roads, supplemented by civilian roads built with an
eye to military use, constituted a network of communications
upon which a new political geography could be framed&mdash;with new
strategic points and new avenues of commerce. Thirdly, the
armies began to emphasize culture and comfort. The soldiers
were given a taste of twentieth century life and standards;
their civilian kin and friends who lived under less favorable conditions
saw in the elite sections of the armies a mass demonstration
of China's modernization.</p>

<p>In the age of air power in China the relation between the army,
the government, and the economy was revolutionized. The new
power of a state with actual authority<sup><a href="#fn75" id="r75">11</a></sup> led to the creation of an
army dependent on an intricate and sensitive financial and
economic system, operating under a regular scheme of law.
The strength of the government made modern armies possible;
modern armies made corresponding political forms imperative.
A resulting tendency was for the armies to take on national form.
Even in those areas where <em>tuch&uuml;nism</em> had left its imprint upon
society, or where provincial autonomy provided a factual check
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_111" title="pg 111"> </a>
upon the national authorities, the regional armies accepted
organizational details and long-range plans set forth by the
central government. Armies which had arisen as dumps for
the unemployed or as resources for civil war were fitted together
so as to make the Chinese forces resemble the other armies of the
world&mdash;which exist for the preservation, defense, or aggrandizement
of national states. Foreign military observers, equipped
with the critical faculties of their profession, might look at the
Chinese armies and state point-blank that China had not an
army but merely armed men. They could not, however, deny
that the Chinese armed forces in their latest phase were on the
way to becoming an army nationally organized and fit to serve
as the instrument of a great nation. The lessons of nearly a
thousand years of European and American political experience
may be epitomized in great part in the word <em>nation</em>; the Chinese
armies helped to give this word true significance in China.</p>

<p>For the time being, the armies continued to serve their role of
a refuge for the economically displaced. Armed paupers are
a menace to the security and stability of any society; with the
emergence of a higher degree of Chinese unity a great proportion
of the armed forces lost their <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em>. Nevertheless, the
last great war-lord war, that of 1930-1931, was fought largely
over the issue of army reduction. The National Government
forces gradually increased in preparation for the disbandment of
others&mdash;extensive bodies of irregulars were roughly systematized
and placed under central supervision. They were used in
moderately successful but insufficient colonization efforts in the
Northwest, and as labor reserves in the construction of highways,
airports, and similar projects. Even so, the size of the armies did
not cease to interfere with their rapid improvement. Too much
had to go into pay, even with the ridiculously low rates of compensation.
As against the estimates of nearly 1,400,000 men
for 1921 and about 1,900,000 for 1926, the size of the armies was
unofficially estimated at 2,379,770 for 1936.<sup><a href="#fn76" id="r76">12</a></sup> This figure did
not include Communists, brigands, or the Manchurian garrisons
in the service of the Japanese (the Manchoukuo army), which
would bring the total to well over 2,500,000 men. Differences
in definition of what made a coolie or peasant into a soldier
caused violent discrepancies in the estimates. If training equal
to that of a German Republican Reichswehr soldier were set
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_112" title="pg 112"> </a>
as the criterion, the Chinese army could be measured in scores.
If some more or less vague relation to a military payroll, or to the
possession of arms, or both, were taken as the requirements, the
number would run into millions. Japanese propagandists, in
the light of these facts, made injudicious statements when commenting
thus on the Chinese army of 1937:</p>

<blockquote><p>China had 198 divisions comprising 2,250,000 officers and men. This
gigantic army has further been reinforced by 200,000 Communist soldiers
whom Nanking worked hard to set against Japan.</p>

<p>In comparison the Japanese Army is a puny affair, consisting of
17 divisions of 250,000 officers and men.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="r77">13</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The well-informed expert on Chinese famine relief, Walter H.
Mallory, set the total for 1937 at 1,650,000, of which 150,000 were
Communist and 350,000 the crack troops of Chiang K'ai-shek;
arms would be available for less than 1,000,000.<sup><a href="#fn78" id="r78">14</a></sup> All factors
considered, the figure of 2,000,000 armed men with nonproductive
occupations seems to be in rough accord with the facts. Two
salient conclusions emerge from these figures: Firstly, the armies
constituted an enormous burden, which could only be reduced by
partial disbandment; this in turn would not be achieved until
greater national prosperity had become a fact. Secondly, and
in China's favor, the armed forces have spread some elementary
notions of modern fighting throughout the rest of the population
and have enhanced not merely the willingness of the Chinese
masses to fight but also their capacity to do so.</p>

<p>Disbandment programs had not made enough progress by
1937 to alter the general position of the armies in Chinese society.
Nevertheless, the counterpart of disbandment&mdash;selective recruiting&mdash;produced
a central force which became the vocation, avocation,
and passion of Generalissimo Chiang K'ai-shek. Though
not marked in any recognizable way as apart from the rest of the
armed forces, the central units were given special arms, special
equipment, regular pay, mass education, and training in the
patriotic and reform doctrines of the New Life movement.
"Chiang's own" were to distinguish themselves; they seem to
have profited by new <em>mat&eacute;riel</em>, modern military instruction
(chiefly from Germans), and the excellent opportunities for
practice which arose from the Communist wars of 1928-1937.
They were a testimonial to the fact that, had the disbandment
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_113" title="pg 113"> </a>
program fully materialized, a more effective and much smaller
Chinese army might have appeared. Despite the failure of
disbandment, alliance with the quondam enemies, the Chinese
Red Army, gave the national forces of 1937 a great diversity and
wealth of actual experience in all types of fighting. Although the
Chinese have never had adequate training for aggressive, coordinated
warfare, they possess a marvelous background in guerrilla
methods. The Communist forces have been hunted for a decade;
technical superiority they have learned to meet by tactics which
force the enemy to meet them on their own terms. Ultimately
they were driven by the Nationalists across China, but at most
disproportionate cost. The Nationalists, on the other hand,
learned to master the terrain of inland war and thus acquired
the very knowledge which a foreign enemy would need most.</p>

<p>In time, the Chinese armies became increasingly less the free
agencies of domestic tyrants and, after the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria, more and more the protective force for the whole
nation. The enemy began to force Chinese society into national
form more sharply than could any pressure from within. Even
the efforts of the National Government at Nanking to make a
truce with the Japanese in order to continue the drive against the
Communists failed to still the widespread clamor for unification.
Whether or not Chiang, as a soldier, thought successful war
with Japan conceivable, he found that destiny had cast him in
the role of the defender&mdash;he had only the choice of accepting or
rejecting the challenge.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Governmental and Political Role of the Armies</a></em></p>

<p>Broadly, the political role of the armies was that of giving a
day-to-day index for the influence of ideological control, and of
providing the framework to which government had to accommodate
itself. The Republic was born with Sun Yat-sen as its
father but with Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai as its midwife. Y&uuml;an and his
armies established the order in which the parliamentary Republic
had its illusory success; with his death the military order broke
into military anarchy, and the political order disappeared almost
completely from the arena of actual power. The armies and the
tuch&uuml;ns expressed a certain provincial autonomy and a desire for
a crude stability. They ruled the chaos but kept the society
stirred by war until the Nationalist-Communist revolution in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_114" title="pg 114"> </a>
1926-1927 brought ideology back to a conspicuous place in the
play of events. The armies developed under Y&uuml;an into separate
entities exercising the power derived from the monopoly of force.
In time this monopoly of force was broken. The problem was
one not of tyranny but of anarchy. Force was too broadly
distributed, order too insufficiently achieved. The Chinese,
said Sun Yat-sen, did not need liberty; they needed wealth, in
the form of food for those starving and the necessities of life for
impoverished millions.<sup><a href="#fn79" id="r79">15</a></sup> When even soldiers were treacherous
and tumultuous, order could not come from bayonets. It had
to arise within men's minds, including the minds of the soldiers.
This happened; the ideological revolution absorbed the military
forces, but only to disgorge them, as it were, into opposing
camps&mdash;the one identifying military power and the masses, the
other seeking to build up a new military elite with which to
impose government and law on the society. Each of the two
incompatible ideals reached a considerable measure of fulfillment,
and they were reconciled only by the very presence of alien
invaders. From being the <em>de facto</em> rulers, the armies found
themselves called upon to act as <em>de facto</em> defenders. Hitherto the
forces unsettling ideological control, they became the instruments
of ideologies reconciled on the minimal terms of national defense
for national existence.</p>

<p>The armies had supplied the power necessary to government
but not the order. The Peking Republic lost its claim to authority
when it was made the tool of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai. The years
after his death were a pitiful period wherein the civilian authorities
in the central government constituted either the puppets of
the war lords or their sycophants. The Peking Republic fell
into the expedient of giving <em>de jure</em> status to every shift in the
interplay of power. Military leaders of provincial importance
easily captured the functions of <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>; regional leaders obtained
correspondingly higher titles. The Peking Republic tried to
govern on the Western pattern when the country was not ready
for it, and it governed poorly. Soon it passed from nominal
control into nonexistence.</p>

<p>The National Government established at Nanking in 1927<sup><a href="#fn80" id="r80">16</a></sup>
gained actual effectiveness partly because the armies under its
command were in need of essentials not obtainable by merely
military measures. The modernized Nationalist armies under
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_115" title="pg 115"> </a>
Chiang K'ai-shek were dependent upon a complementing state
which would provide support behind the lines. Furthermore, the
cry from the educated classes for civilian government was loud,
and practical considerations prompted the acquiescence of the
Nationalist generals in the development of civilian government.
Although by 1938 a government primarily civilian was not yet
in evidence, the auspices were favorable to the regularization
and demilitarization of government.</p>

<p>Finally, the most significant role of the armies may be found in
their destructive powers. Modern weapons coming into China
pressed on her the mold of a modern state. By preventing any
tranquil change from the Ch'ing dynasty to another form of
government preserving the older controls of village and family,
Western armament brought China into a condition of military
anarchy in which a strong modern government became imperative.
The armies and their irresponsible leaders goaded the
masses into the revolution of 1926-1927, and the necessity of
establishing military superiority for the sake of stability led the
victorious Nationalists to create a modern defensive force, a
working government, and the outline of operative statehood&mdash;to
be partly Chinese, but modified by Western influences, according
to the teachings of Sun Yat-sen. From 1931 on, the army and
the government became more and more the integral parts of a
single machine.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">War and the Agrarian Economy</a></em></p>

<p>There is a close correlation between militarism and agricultural
conditions in China. Distress among the Chinese farming
masses is both a cause and an effect of war. Misery creates
unrest, unrest brings war, war brings misery&mdash;until government
stops the vicious circle. On the whole, the economic system of
old China was probably more stable, and ensured greater distributive
justice, than did the Western systems during the same
centuries; but periods of famine, flood, and&mdash;worst of all&mdash;oppression
were far from rare.<sup><a href="#fn81" id="r81">17</a></sup></p>

<p>At its best, the old economy rested on a vast body of farmers,
associated in villages (<em>hui</em>) and families but tilling their own
land in fairly small units. The farming class provided the nourishment
for the bulk of society but did not hold a low status,
since the compensations of interclass kinship and of free play
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_116" title="pg 116"> </a>
in the hierarchy of politics and intellect made families (if not
individuals) approximately equal. There were no families in
old China to compare with the aristocracy which Europe inherited
from the Middle Ages, nor castes to compare with those of
India. When functioning well, the Chinese economic system
resembled some Western ideals of freehold farming governed by
a hierarchy of scholars.</p>

<p>But at its worst, when the government became sterile and
unimaginative, or corrupt and demoralized, the taxes rose
sharply, and usurers added to the burden. Lack of resources
caused the loss of the land, and the peasant proprietor found
himself a tenant farmer. When economic and political exploitation
overreached itself, social upheaval followed, and peasant
rebellions tore down the government and the economy together.
Most Chinese dynasties met their end as a consequence of the
land problem.<sup><a href="#fn82" id="r82">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Moreover, the Chinese farmer maintained very slight reserves
of foodstuffs, so that flood or drought resulted in appalling
famines, sometimes costing the lives of millions in one year.
Governments established large granaries which, under good
management, were filled in time of plenty and dispersed in time
of need. R. H. Tawney says of drought and flood:</p>

<blockquote><p>Those directly affected by them cannot meet the blow, for they have
no reserves. The individual cannot be rescued by his neighbors, since
whole districts together are in the same position. The district cannot
be rescued by the nation, because means of communication do not permit
of food being moved in sufficient quantities. Famine is, in short, the
last stage of a disease which, though not always conspicuous, is always
present.<sup><a href="#fn83" id="r83">19</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Whether or not natural calamities struck in conjunction with
specific extortions sanctioned by social injustice, the Chinese
farmer has been faced with threefold oppression whenever times
were bad. The tax collector, the usurer, and the landlord were
able to lay their hands on the harvest, reduce the peasant to
subsistence level or beneath it, and place him under a system of
exploitation which was as severe as Western feudalism. The
check which provided a stop to any indefinite decline into greater
and greater horror was the fighting power of the peasants.
Peasant revolts periodically followed agrarian oppression, and
swept the land free for the time. The Han dynasty, in some ways
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_117" title="pg 117"> </a>
the greatest in all Chinese history, went down in an uproar of
peasant rebellions. Peasant bandits have provided the ancestry
of many imperial houses. Politics or war might ease the economy,
until the government again became weak and exploitation
common.</p>

<p>It is one of the tragic coincidences of history that the Europeans
should have appeared in China at a time when the Chinese were
entering upon one of their most acute periods of agrarian decline
and class exploitation. Roughly, from the middle of the eighteenth
century down to the present day the lot of the Chinese
farmers has become worse and worse. At periods the country as a
whole seemed fairly prosperous, but the broad agricultural recession
remained constant. The nineteenth century was one long
record of rebellions, and the twentieth amplified the disturbances.</p>

<p>Government in modern China has fallen heir to a depression
centuries old, arising from inequitable land distribution, overtaxation,
insufficient public works for drainage and communications,
and&mdash;in more recent generations&mdash;the evils attendant
upon sharp economic change. Most economic writers agree
that some of the difficulties of Chinese agriculture are caused by
the smallness of individual holdings and by population pressure.
Such factors are not subject to immediate remedy; the peasants
have attributed their misfortune primarily to landlordism and
political oppression. The Chinese Communists, on their
economic front, may perform a valuable service if they are able
to devise new methods of social organization which will provide
relief for the organic difficulties of Chinese agriculture. Of
all the important problems of China, the land problem shows
government ineffectiveness at its worst.</p>

<p>Behind the T'ai-p'ing rebellion which flared up in unparalleled
fanaticism in the 1850's and 1860's, there was the long provocation
of a land system which made farming unprofitable and a
government supine in the face of unreversed decline. The Boxer
rebellion burst forth from the unrest of the peasants, although
it could be deflected by the demagoguery of the Manchu officials
and changed into wild xenophobia. When the fiercely discordant
economics of imperialism and international industrialism intruded
upon the old and already corrupted economy, farm existence
became even less tolerable than it might have been if left to
its native miseries. Dynastic decomposition was hastened by
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_118" title="pg 118"> </a>
the collapse of handicraft economy and the fiscal disorganization
caused by Western commercial activity.</p>

<p>In the earliest days of the Republican-Nationalist movement
led by Sun Yat-sen, emphasis was on land reform. Sun Yat-sen's
family had suffered from overtaxation when he was a boy.<sup><a href="#fn84" id="r84">20</a></sup>
Nationalization and equalization of the land were slogans used
at the founding of the <em>Tung M&ecirc;ng Hui</em>; the program seems at
that time to have been derived from old Chinese distributism
and from Henry George.<sup><a href="#fn85" id="r85">21</a></sup> With the coming of the Republic,
two years went by, however, before any agrarian legislation was
passed, and the new laws had no perceptible consequence.<sup><a href="#fn86" id="r86">22</a></sup>
The problem of land reform had to be fought out on the ideological
front and placed above the military before it could
become a fit subject for competent government action.</p>

<p>The epoch of the <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> added to agricultural misfortune.
Militarism had a direct effect on the deterioration of the land
economy, and an indirect one in that it led to the cultivation of
opium as the one money-making crop which could meet the
excessive tax demands of the militarists. A Chinese writer has
described the years which marked the ending of the <em>tuch&uuml;n</em>
system as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ... misery among the farming population in the decennial
period 1920-1930 [must be] attributed to (1) internal warfare; (2) neglect
of agriculture; (3) low stage of art; and (4) over-population. The civil
wars during the last eighteen years have increased the cost of production,
have added to the farmers' ... burden of taxation, have raised
the rate of interest on loan, and have caused endless suffering to [those]
who form the basis of our social and economic life. Great many
people have often wondered as to why a country like China with 75 per
cent of her total population engaged in farming and with such a vast
territory should suffer from the high cost of living; but to the student
of social problems the question is comparatively simple, for the recurrence
of civil war since the establishment of the Republic has [changed]
conditions of supply and has driven millions of farmers out of cultivated
areas, and this alone suffices to explain an unprecedented rise of prices
of food and other necessities of life during the last few years, especially
since 1926.<sup><a href="#fn87" id="r87">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These conditions led to farmers' movements, which became
effective, however, only as they merged with the broader ideological
tendencies in China.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_119" title="pg 119"> </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Farmers' Movement ... may ... be divided into four
periods: (1) the period of reaction to bad conditions ... (1921-1925);
(2) the period of communistic activities and violence (1925-1927); (3)
the period of retrenchment and preparation for reconstruction (from
the spring of 1927-1928); and (4) the period of reconstruction (since
1928).<sup><a href="#fn88" id="r88">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Kuomintang-Communist alliance struck severely at the
<em>tuch&uuml;n</em> armies by giving their own forces a sense of doctrine
and by tying together the causes of patriotism and agricultural
reform. The joint agrarian program was a failure in that it
accentuated precisely those issues on which neither of the parties
could compromise. When the Communists and the Nationalists
parted, the Nationalists took one portion of Sun Yat-sen's
economic program (industrialization and communications) for
emphasis, and the Communists another (land reform). The
agrarian issue was a source of strength to the Chinese Red
Army, intent upon winning the peasantry. It was a military
weakness to the new-style Nationalist armies officered largely
by the relatives of landlords; they had little sympathy for the
economic troubles of the farmers whose lands they occupied.
The Nationalist Reconstruction aimed in great part at removing
both the acute and the latent causes of peasant rebellion, thereby
cutting the ground from under the feet of the Communists.
Although it met with more success than any other project of
its type in modern China, Western observers agree in regarding
it as inadequate.<sup><a href="#fn89" id="r89">25</a></sup></p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Imperialism and Chinese Wars</a></em></p>

<p>A great part of the military disturbances in modern China can
be regarded as both the cause and the effect of agrarian evils,
and some of the struggles as peasant rebellions in modern guise,
carrying on the immemorial farmer-infantry tradition. Another
part is traceable to the impact of the Western economy on China.
It was Western economic activity that gave most compelling
proof of the fact that the Westerners had encircled China and
were compressing it from a world in its own right into a nation.
The military intervention of Western powers in China not only
caused much of the ideological reaction and forced a reorganization
of the government, but also provided deadly evidence of the
superiority of Western fighting. Western economy helped to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_120" title="pg 120"> </a>
bring the confusion which meant war in China; and Western
economy itself waged war.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen saw China's unfortunate position as a whole,
and in his programs there may be discerned three separate
demands, for (1) a national economic revolution, (2) an industrial
revolution, and (3) a social revolution.<sup><a href="#fn90" id="r90">26</a></sup> Since the Chinese
could no longer function as a self-contained world economically,
and scorn foreign trade as a magnanimous concession to the outer
barbarians,<sup><a href="#fn91" id="r91">27</a></sup> the Chinese would have to develop an economic
system conforming to national patterns in the society and in
thought. They must relate their economy to their independence
and defense, if they were to survive. In the first place, they
could not afford to remain the only free market of the world,
subject to exploitation and haphazard development. It would
be necessary for them to establish governmental controls over
economic matters and protect their national livelihood. Secondly,
they had to work toward a complete transformation of
their technological system and meet Western productive practices,
if they were to claim a competitive position; this involved
an industrial revolution. Thirdly, they had to correct the abuses
inherited from their forefathers. Simultaneously they would
have to construct an economic system not only modern but
equitable, if they wished to avoid the horrors of early capitalism
and the tragedy of the industrialist class war. This would
require a social revolution.</p>

<p>At the time that Sun Yat-sen formulated his ideas (1924),
none of the three revolutions was making any progress. The
Chinese did not constitute a nation in fact; they had even
lost the old unity of the Confucian society. The <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> opposed
Chinese nationalism by preventing the development of any
one authority able to monopolize force, and by acting as agents
of, or in alliance with, foreign powers. Thus they helped to
make China something not far from a quasi colony under pooled
control of all the industrial capitalist nations. The Nationalists
and Communists were able to join forces on this issue of a class
war of nations, both believing in the independence of China.
The Nationalists, however, saw China's most direct approach
toward national unity in the development of a national economic
system, with a reasonable military independence of imports
and the economic devices current throughout the world as
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_121" title="pg 121"> </a>
instruments of national policy. The Communists did not
agree that such an economy, national in form, would have much
meaning unless it were grounded upon a peasant-proletarian
regime. Nor did they feel that change from imperialist to
native capitalism would constitute an advance in itself.</p>

<p>After the schism, the Nationalists devoted themselves to the
national-economic and industrial revolutions, while the Communists
stressed the social revolution, particularly the land
problem. The Nationalists were able to secure tariff autonomy
for China, and thereupon entered upon a policy of protective
tariffs and other mechanisms designed to make China a reasonably
self-sufficient nation. At the same time they pushed
hard toward the industrial revolution, in developing highways,
railroads, airways, and radio, and in creating the economic
controls required for modern government&mdash;standard weights,
measures, currency, civil law, and fiscal uniformity.</p>

<p>T. V. Soong (Sung Tz&#365;-w&ecirc;n), a veteran minister of finance,
stands out as the organizer of the modern Chinese economy.
Veritable miracles were performed in the development of national
credit; after 1928 the National Government adopted the policy&mdash;as
remote as a mirage to its predecessors&mdash;of floating all government
loans within the country and making the Chinese government
independent of Japanese and Western financiers. The
only loans of any importance contracted abroad were taken up
with other governments. Financial independence was a great
step toward the realization of the Nationalist ideals, but it may
be questioned whether the loss of financial allies was a price to
be paid without hesitation in a capitalist world. Had the
Chinese had more bonds in the Western capital markets, or
larger debts to the American or British governments, they might
have elicited greater international support in repelling the
Japanese invasion in 1931.</p>

<p>The crowning point in the economic achievements of the
National Government at Nanking was the successful institution
of a managed currency. China had dealt with currency merely
as a convenient form for specie, and the Chinese were accustomed
to regard a dollar as worth only the amount of metal in it. When
the National Government placed the currency on a national
basis, it drew together the whole financial structure of China
by one gigantic move, and placed finance in a position of greater
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_122" title="pg 122"> </a>
unity and dependence upon government than ever before.
Together with the financial reforms, the Nationalists organized a
legal system providing a minimum foundation of law and order.
The codification of laws, the revamping of the judiciary, the
clarification of policies by legal formulation&mdash;all these contributed
to China's emergent nationhood.</p>

<p>The economic program accorded with considerations partly
Hamiltonian, partly state-socialist. The economy had first of
all to be organized and integrated in national terms, and later
to be revised so as to ensure social justice. The Nationalists
were convinced that a policy of immediate land reform would
lead to internal disharmony and frustrate the very purposes for
which the revolution of 1926-1927 had been launched. The
Communists, on the other hand, succeeded in keeping the
agrarian issue from being forgotten and forced the Nationalists
to better the lot of the peasant. In the meantime, China's
boom in physical development and the unification of the commercial,
financial, productive, and legal systems began to
startle observers.</p>

<p>As a result, China was able to build national armies in direct
ratio with the invigoration of her national economic system.
The war machine of the National Government, under the care
and leadership of Generalissimo Chiang K'ai-shek, became
the most powerful in China. The central government's military
power in turn speeded up the pace of general unification. There
was thus a remarkable interaction of forces tending toward national
integration. From 1932 to 1937, between the first and second
major phases of the Japanese invasion, progress was rapid&mdash;stimulated,
perhaps, by the external menace.</p>

<p>The two greatest dangers to the Nationalist policy of military
and economic unification were (1) the dismal condition of the
Chinese proletariat, as yet small but constantly growing, and
(2) the vested interests of the industrial powers. Had China's
growth been less rapid, the foreigners might have withdrawn
slowly and found compensation in Chinese commerce for their
losses in direct ownership in China. There was one power,
however, to which Chinese unification was a living and increasing
threat. The rising military-economic power of the Chinese was
incompatible with the position which Japanese leaders visualized
as part of the manifest destiny of their country. The Japanese
might have tolerated the <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> system for decades had the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123" title="pg 123"> </a>
<em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> been able to establish orderly regional governments;
or they might have aided a reactionary Chinese regime which
asked for survival only. The appearance of a genuine republic
in the Far East was a menace to Japan; if that republic was
bound by sheer physical proportions to overshadow Japan,
the unification and modernization of China had to be averted
at all costs.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, China's development, even apart from the
hindrances of war, cannot be regarded as possessing the same
potentialities as did American growth during the past century.
China, from all indications available to date, is an area much
poorer in natural resources than is the United States; she does
not offer comparable opportunities for the heavy industries.
The steel, coal, oil, and water power necessary for large-scale
industrialization are by no means negligible, but not sufficient to
make possible the rise of another America. The far future may
change man's dependence upon currently utilized resources and
facilitate greater strides in China's technological advancement.
Meanwhile, she can look forward to decades of measurable
development through exploiting raw materials already available,
if political conditions permit.</p>

<p>The conflict with Japan has thrown Chinese economic development
back to conditions not too far from the pre-Nanking stage.
China not only faces the handicaps of social dislocations but
also the ruin of her factories and her industrial centers. The
Japanese have destroyed much of the Chinese manufacturing
equipment and are placing what remains under Japanese control.
Significantly, the deadliest enemy of Japanese business&mdash;in the
unlikely event of a complete Japanese success&mdash;will be Japanese-owned
factories in China. Chinese labor will deeply affect
Japan's domestic production, unless the Japanese succeed in
rationalizing their economic system to an extent not yet contemplated.
Hence, Japan's losing the war may well be brought
about by bankruptcy from sheer military indebtedness; her
winning the war, however, may lead to more remote but no
less certain ruin&mdash;through the competition of Chinese output
with Japanese home industries disadvantaged by the cheaper
labor markets of China. But Japan's loss is not inevitably
China's gain, and the Chinese may find themselves, at some point
in the future, controlling an industrial system which has been
wrecked, looted, and bankrupted.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" title="pg 124"> </a></p>

<p>Whatever the ultimate outcome, loans will again play a part in
Chinese development. The placing of large foreign loans has
been a key part of Chinese development, and the task of reconstruction
in China&mdash;no matter who undertakes to do it&mdash;will
require large amounts of capital. Consequently, the loan policies
of the wealthier nations may return to the importance which
they enjoyed in 1913, and the dictates of the Western states
may again direct the lines of Chinese economic progress. The
effects of the Japanese conquest, if it is partial and then lapses
into a stalemate, may well be determined by the extension of
loans to the Chinese or to the Japanese in China. The effect
of the war has already complicated the picture of China's economic
future to the extent of making even cautious prophecy
hazardous.<sup><a href="#fn92" id="r92">28</a></sup></p>

<p>In the military sphere, the Chinese have come of age, although
their fighting strength will be determined by the importance
of infantry. If later wars continue to depend upon man power,
China will become more and more significant in world politics.
Internally, the armies provided (1) a transitional administration
from the Empire to the Republic; (2) a physical expression of
the ideological confusion and the regional disunity of China from
1916 to 1931 (the period of <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>); (3) the armed edge of the
ideological revolution of 1926-1927; (4) decisive instruments
in the conflict between the Communists and Nationalists from
1927 to 1937; and (5) one of the most powerful unifying agencies
at the command of the National Government at Nanking.
The Chinese military system spread the knowledge of Western
warfare and, with it, of modern techniques throughout the
country; it shaped the ideological and governmental experience
of modern China.</p>

GOVERNMENTS</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>




<h3><em>Chapter</em> VI</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">THE EMPIRE</a></h2>


<p>The governing of China is not and has not been confined to
governments. In many instances the working of specific institutions
called <em>governments</em> has been of less importance than that of
other establishments and organizations. The problems of government
in Republican China are affected but not determined by the
fate of individual governments. Movements and armies have
predetermined action; governments have reflected it. Government
in China may be divided into three chief periods. The
first extends from prehistory to 221 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> The second is the
imperial period.<sup><a href="#fn93" id="r93">1</a></sup> The third&mdash;the Republican epoch&mdash;did not
begin until 1912, although it was foreshadowed in the nineteenth
century.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Government to the End of the Warring States</a></em></p>

<p>In the semihistoric Shang dynasty, which ruled China during
the second millennium <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, there was a central overlordship
which might well have claimed primacy over all offices of the
world. In its own territory, Shang rule seems to have been
based not upon a feudal system such as developed later in the
time of the charioteering lords but upon the reduction of defeated
princes to positions of vassaldom. History cannot yet tell of
the exact relations between the Shang overlord and his vassal
princes, nor of other monarchs who, in the shadowy bypaths
of present knowledge, stand forth vaguely from complete
obscurity as rivals to the hegemony of Shang. The rulers of
twenty-five or twenty-six centuries ago are recognized by modern
Chinese as the direct predecessors of the Ch'ing emperor who
in turn yielded to the Republic. This is no case of a Mussolini
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_127" title="pg 127"> </a>
seeking to weave together the long-broken threads between
Augustan and modern Rome; in China the succession is as direct
as that from St. Pius I to Pius XI. The central monarchy
comes over the edge of history as an identifiable institution.</p>

<p>In rudimentary form this monarchy already suggests the
features of bureaucracy. Like the Prussian kings thousands of
years later, the Shang monarchs seem to have relied upon
commoners as their royal officials, and for the same reasons. A
commoner strengthened the position of the monarch: "He could
not easily usurp the place of his master, even if he had the power.
And if he was disobedient he could be executed on the spot, with
complete impunity; he had no powerful clan to exact vengeance."<sup><a href="#fn94" id="r94">2</a></sup>
Whether or not the system of loose overlordship be termed
<em>feudalism</em>, social forms not too unlike European feudalism
originated under the next dynasty, the Chou (traditionally
dated 1122-256 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>). Conquering the great city of the Shang,
the Chou turned to feudalism for means of internal control
and defense. Powerful vassals arose, however, so that after
the eighth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> the original Chou dynasty was no
longer in actual command. From the eighth to the third century
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, when China was consolidated under the Ch'in Shih Huang
Ti, a rapid spread of feudal organization brought about a state
system resembling that of early modern Europe.</p>

<p>Before the Chou rulers lost their power and became the
faraway analogues of the late Holy Roman emperors or the
Tennos of shogunal Japan, there emerged from their house one
of the most remarkable of all Chinese political leaders. The
Duke of Chou, who lived in the eleventh century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, seems
to have done most in founding the system which later ages
called <em>Confucian</em>&mdash;after Confucius had reformed it, clarified it,
and given it ethical stature. He is also regarded as the father
of the Constitution of Chou, a plan for a bureaucratic monarchy
with an emperor, three Great Dukes, and six ministers (in charge
of administrative, educational and economic, religious and
historiographic, military, judicial, and engineering matters,
respectively) ruling over nine large provinces.<sup><a href="#fn95" id="r95">3</a></sup> The Duke of
Chou is finally credited with the authorship of several important
treatises. He has served as the archetype of intellectual statesmanship
in Chinese legend. His work may have contributed
in great part to the long life of the Chou dynasty, as a <em>de jure</em>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_128" title="pg 128"> </a>
ruling house, since a family which had produced such an eminent
member was not to be set aside lightly.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of this period the feudal order seems to
have ensured relative stability, but in the later part a system
of states arose. The greatest Chinese philosophers, Confucius
(Kung Fu-tz&#365;) and Lao Tz&#365;, lived in interstate turmoil. They
saw all about them the displacement of virtues which had long
been recognized, the advance of states which substituted greed
for morality, the centralization of power, the destruction of the
feudal economy, the transformation of ceremonial warfare into
outright slaughter, and the rising disrespect of the advancing
kings for the Chou overlord. Lao Tz&#365; preached a philosophy
devoid of constructive politics; he had little use for the state
and for the organization of society. Not quite an anarchist, his
programs are probably closer to those of Herbert Spencer than
of any other Western thinker. But the spiritual and psychological
background from which he wrote is roughly identical
with that of the world's great mystical intuitionists. Confucius
(551-479 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) preached a system of ethics and education which
was to rationalize and systematize preceding Chinese thought
and lead to the system of ideological control known as
Confucian.</p>

<p>Chinese historians themselves term the closing period of the
Chou the Age of Warring States. Diplomacy lubricated the
machinery of conflict, smoothing struggle without eliminating
it. The regional governments fought each other for centuries,
though at times venturing into collective security pacts entrusting
authority to a preeminent king for defense against the outer
barbarians. The last years of interstate wars, however, were
marked by an ever increasing awareness of the meaningless
character of a struggle which had enveloped the Chinese world.
Legalism and militarism, twin media of centralized monarchy,
blossomed forth. While the Western political system, molded
by geography and conditioned by language, has frozen into a
pattern of theoretically sovereign and theoretically eternal
states&mdash;the "mortal Gods" of Hobbes's imagination&mdash;without
promise of workable universal government, China's states were
swept aside by the conqueror Ch'in Shih Huang Ti, who established
imperial unity for Chinese government. With the rise
to domination of the state of Ch'in, its king took the title of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_129" title="pg 129"> </a>
<em>Shih</em> (First) <em>Huang Ti</em> (Emperor), and the Chinese Empire was
established.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Chinese Imperial Government</a></em></p>

<p>The Shih Huang Ti was not revered by succeeding ages for
the great mission which he performed. His methods were
those not of a cautious reformer but of a bullying conqueror.
With the aid and advice of a legalist philosopher, he organized
all of China (covering the area of much of modern China) into a
strongly centralized and despotic military monarchy. He
destroyed all books not of obvious practical use, completely
eradicating the histories of rival states and the works of philosophers
whose opinions might undermine his regime. His tyranny
brought his house to a rapid end; his heirs held the throne only
a short while. But the work he had done was done. He had
persecuted the worship of the past. He had extirpated a large
part of the literature which might have survived as a source of
dissent. He had cleared China of all military power but his own.
He had brought operative law into being and had spread the
institution of private ownership of land. Feudalism might
remain as a form, but its economic and political realities were
lost.</p>

<p>In 206 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> there began the reign of the Han dynasty. They
effected a compromise between the past and the governmental,
military, and political system created by the Shih Huang Ti.
They retained legalism in practice but turned more and more to
Confucianism. Under them the cult of Confucius grew into the
major influence on the state.<sup><a href="#fn96" id="r96">4</a></sup> The Han allowed the imperial
system to grow, whereas the Shih Huang Ti had sought to build
it. In consequence, Han rule&mdash;although interrupted in the
time of Christ by a Utopian usurper&mdash;lasted from the third
century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> to the third century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> There followed the
turbulent Chinese middle ages, extending until the reinstitution
of organized government with the Chin and the Sui.<sup><a href="#fn97" id="r97">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Out of the earliest tradition attributed to the Duke of Chou
and put in definite shape by Confucius, out of the arbitrary
military despotism of the conqueror of the Chinese world, Shih
Huang Ti, and out of the actual practices of the Han, there
evolved a governmental system which, though altered dynasty
by dynasty and epoch by epoch, nevertheless retained its general
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_130" title="pg 130"> </a>
form down into the days of men now living. It never became,
however, the prime agency of government, even of the men
governing. Ritual and scholarship were more significant
functions of the dominant hierarchy than was administration
itself. The emperor was the head of the country's family
structure, the focal point in the social sphere, the outstanding
member of the community at large, the chief examiner and
model of the scholars, the pontiff of the quasi-religious hierarchy,
the moral scapegoat and intermediary between destiny and
mankind, and the autocrat of a despotism constitutionalized,
as it were, by the power of traditional practices.</p>

<p>The imperial system of China was thus a monarchy in the
proper sense of the word, with none of the parvenu features
suggested by the etymology of the word <em>imperial</em>. As the preeminent
leader in an organic society, the emperor held a position
comparable with that of other family heads. His authority could
rival that of a father but not excel it; among all the families of
the Chinese Empire the imperial stood forth as a family. Second,
the emperor was the chief dignitary in the social life of the
Chinese world. He was not unlike the British monarchs, providing
a model of formal propriety and elegance in setting the
fashions of the decade. The physical isolation of most of the
emperors prevented them from playing this role with widespread
effectiveness, but it was a part of their function. Third, the
emperor bore the relation to the Empire which the outstanding
villager bore to the village. It was he of whom men talked;
his behavior commanded greatest interest; his future conduct
was a constant source of speculation. Apart from his role as a
formal dignitary, he occupied the more immediate position of
most conspicuous person, of the first member of society. He
had the human accountability of a leader and was to be praised
or blamed for his actions in the histories and by his subjects.
In the normal routine, the emperor himself was not to govern; but
he selected and supervised his ministers, who did and who
consequently bore the odium for evil deeds.</p>

<p>Fourth, the emperor himself was the ultimate examiner of
scholars. He thus had contact with the most successful of the
civil service candidates and completed their examination.
These examinations served the emperor as a means of selecting
advisers who upon further testing became ministers. The Forest
of Pencils (<em>Han Lin</em>, the Imperial Academy) was within his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_131" title="pg 131"> </a>
jurisdiction, and the emperor was supposed to be enough of a
scholar to check the most important of the documents of state.
The myth of intellectual supremacy is suggested by the fact
that the chief implement of the imperial office was a red pencil.
The imperial symbolism did not stop here. Fifth, the quasi-religious
hierarchy of the Chinese, competing with Buddhism
and the superstitions of popular Taoism for the support of the
people, centered on the performance of certain rites in the propitiation
of fortune and the honoring of the dead. To this were
added the cult rituals of Confucianism. The Confucian temples,
with tablets bearing the names of worthies, served as the visible
demonstration of the ideological power wielded by the scholars
over the populace, and of the emperor over the scholars.</p>

<p>Sixth, the emperor had the more definitely religious status
referred to in his title <em>Son of Heaven</em>. He was the intermediate
figure between the will of Heaven and mankind. In him were
summarized and epitomized the virtues or the evils of the generation;
he had to represent mankind in its best light to all supernatural
forces or agencies. Upon his conduct of worship
depended the good or ill will of the deities and hence weather,
crops, life and death. Conversely, he was responsible to mankind
for the misbehavior of nature, and an earthquake, a two-headed
calf, or any other monstrous occurrence was blamed on his
disturbance of the routine of things. The order which enveloped
the Confucian society was conceived not merely as a set of traditional
and moral man-made customs but as a type of behavior
which fitted in with the life of the natural world. In the eyes
of the Chinese, perturbations in the world of men soon produced
consequent natural calamities. Lastly, the Chinese emperor
was the autocrat of the administration. His action, however,
was limited by various customary devices; for example, while the
countersignature of a minister was not needed on an edict, the
emperor was supposed not to take the initiative but to secure
the wisest suggestions and adopt them. Practical considerations
rendered a stable bureaucracy impervious to constant intermeddling
of the emperor, although the effect of imperial action
was not negligible.</p>

<p>The administrative outline of Chinese government from the
establishment of the Empire by the Ch'in Shih Huang Ti in
221 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> to its overthrow by Sun Yat-sen and his followers in
1911 varied from dynasty to dynasty and ruler to ruler. Nevertheless,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_132" title="pg 132"> </a>
certain general characteristics were common to the whole
period. The government operated as the chief implementation
of the emperor's power over the people. The people maintained
its social organizations, but none of these developed office
hierarchies comparable to that of the government. The government
alone served as the connecting link between the ideologically
unified Chinese world as a whole and its many separate parts.
The T'ang dynasty (<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 620-906) provided an exceptionally
clear articulation of the Empire, which not only compelled the
admiration and imitation of later ages but even served as a model
for state governments on the periphery of the Chinese world.
In the great Taikwa Reforms of 645, the Japanese made a heroic
attempt to adapt the T'ang form of government to dissimilar
conditions; the scheme worked on paper but failed to recast the
fundamental mold of Japanese society, which remained feudal.</p>

<p>The three most striking features of the Chinese bureaucracy
were: (1) the central administrative organization; (2) the operation
of civil service examinations and the use of administrative
supervision; (3) the integration of government operation on the
imperial, regional, and local levels. The metropolitan administrative
organization under the T'ang dynasty was headed by
the emperor. But the intricate regularity of the hierarchy
beneath him was such as to preclude imperial autocratic caprice.
The outline of the hierarchical organization was as follows:<sup><a href="#fn98" id="r98">6</a></sup></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_133" title="pg 133"> </a></p>

<p>The general structure of Chinese administration differed little
from that of preceding ages, and has not changed markedly
during the following centuries. Later developments strengthened
the provinces, at the expense of both the central government
and the local areas; earlier conditions had tolerated a much
greater extent of feudal establishments. Nevertheless, the six
ministries may have been established as early as about 1000
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and remained a feature of Chinese government until 1906.</p>

<p>The Grand Council met daily. It was composed of grand
ministers, who&mdash;in the phrase of Baron des Rotours&mdash;"under
the T'ang held in their hands the government of the Empire."<sup><a href="#fn99" id="r99">7</a></sup>
The emperor's chief power lay in appointing the council
members, to whom fell the greater share of governing in fact.
Directly under the Grand Council there were the three departments.
The Department of Ministerial Coordination served
as an administrative center and clearinghouse for the work of
the separate ministries under it. The names of the ministries
are self-explanatory. The Ministry of Administrators was in
charge of the examination system and the arrangement of the
offices in the bureaucracy. The Ministry of Rites, by an
extension of its protocol features, was in charge of the reception
of foreign ("barbarian") princes and ambassadors, and emissaries.
The other two departments provided one of the most
ingenious systems of checks and balances to be found in any
constitutional scheme. The Imperial Chancery received all
communications from the various parts of the Empire. Since
most of the governing was carried out by means of written orders,
instructions, and requests for reports, the Chancery occupied
an important place. But the function of drafting replies to such
communications, preparing manifestoes, or issuing ordinances
was in the hands of the Grand Secretariat. Thus the Chancery
was prevented from exerting an outside influence, while it was
impossible for the Secretariat to receive any communication
directly. As a final check, all outgoing documents of state had
to pass through the Chancery to receive the official seal, without
which they were invalid. Thus any item of government business
was routed first through the Chancery for registration and
classification, then to the Secretariat for reply, and back to the
Chancery for what amounted to countersignature (by seal).<sup><a href="#fn100" id="r100">8</a></sup>
Yet the Secretariat was no mere drafting agency for the Chancery.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_134" title="pg 134"> </a></p>

<p>The Tribunal of Censors occupied a position not unlike that
of the great independent establishments of the United States
government. It was directed by a president and two vice-presidents,
and concerned itself with ferreting out and exposing
irregularities and abuses in the administration. The morale
of the censorate varied from time to time, but at its optimum
efficiency it was a formidable and significant institution. Han
Confucianism provided the general background from which the
organization rose to effectiveness.</p>

<p>This sophisticated and rationally designed central bureaucracy
was supplemented by regional administrations. Under the
T'ang the regional establishments were a source of trouble to
the government. The Empire was divided into provinces,
but the provincial administrations were superseded by Imperial
Commissioners whenever an emergency arose. Later dynasties
placed the provincial system on a more stable basis, which
resulted in genuine and geographically sound regionalism.
The provincial governments were replicas in miniature of the
central; their heads might be regarded as appointive and removable
satraps whose authority was a smaller reproduction of the
power of the emperor. It was not until the Ming dynasty
(<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1368-1643) that the provinces took on their modern form.
The provincial governments were a source of great strength to
China in that they made possible a quasi-federal government.
In the Ch'ing period no officer was eligible to a post in his native
province;<sup><a href="#fn101" id="r101">9</a></sup> this custom had considerable centripetal effect and
offset the danger that populace and officials, united by common
sympathies, might revolt or secede.<sup><a href="#fn102" id="r102">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Another feature to be noted about the Chinese government
under the Empire was the examination and civil service system.
The T'ang dynasty provided for three major types of examination:
(1) The <em>ch&uuml;</em> corresponded most closely to a modern academic
degree, and allowed the candidate to qualify in any one of a
number of subjects, including the classics, law, and mathematics.
(2) The <em>hs&uuml;an</em> was the special examination necessary for appointment
to a post in the bureaucracy; it was both written and oral
and included the personal history of the candidate. (3) The
<em>k'ao</em>, an in-service examination, consisted of annual reports on
the performance of all officers in the Empire. They were
transmitted to the Bureau for Examination of Merits in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_135" title="pg 135"> </a>
Ministry of Administrators on a schedule varying with the distance
of the office from the capital. There were five points on
which to report: virtue and justice; integrity and circumspection;
equity and impartiality; diligence and activity; and one of
twenty-seven special talents suitable to the particular office
in question. The grades received on these reports determined
the advancement or demotion of the officer, in accordance
with an elaborate and exact schedule.<sup><a href="#fn103" id="r103">11</a></sup> All three examinations
provided the administrative form for the close relation between
the government and the scholastic elite. The <em>ch&uuml;</em>, with its
emphasis on the classics, framed the content of all curriculums.
The <em>hs&uuml;an</em>, with its oral examination and personal record, made
the prospective candidate careful in observing the customs. The
<em>k'ao</em> kept up the morale and efficiency of the bureaucracy, while
the ominous Tribunal of Censors was present to guard against
abuse of the system. Every detail was precise, well ordered,
explicit, to a degree that would delight present-day industrial
personnel managers. Formulation was refined and impressive.
In fact the T'ang laws, although their part in Chinese life was
less than a Westerner might expect, were a code of such force
and appeal that the Japanese and the Annamese used them as a
model for their juridical systems.<sup><a href="#fn104" id="r104">12</a></sup></p>

<p>The decline of particular dynasties in China&mdash;caused by poor
economic policy, demoralization of the court, corruption of the
bureaucracy, laxity in the examinations, oppression of the farmers&mdash;did
not effect great alterations in the structure of government.
With the centuries the Chinese government settled into more and
more definitive form. Unfortunately, the Manchu government
(1644-1911)<sup><a href="#fn105" id="r105">13</a></sup> had sunk into administrative demoralization when
the full force of the Western impact was felt. In the early nineteenth
century a British observer wrote of an imperial official:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The late <em>tungling</em> [gendarmerie commander] Wanking, degraded last
year for connecting himself with a magician whose confessions went to
implicate a large number of nobles and public servants, was a Reader
at the Classical Feasts, Manchu President of the Board of Civil Office,
Revisor-General of the Veritable Records of the Reign, a Superior of the
Academy, Supervisor of the Household, t'utung of a Banner [military
division], superintendent of the Gymnasium in the Ning-shan Palace,
and of the Treasuries of the Board of Revenue, and Visitor of the 17
Granaries in the City, and at Tungchau.<sup><a href="#fn106" id="r106">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_136" title="pg 136"> </a></p>

<p>When such conditions of indifference toward sharply defined
hierarchic ethics began to be common among the bureaucracy,
the end of the dynasty was near. The Chinese Empire had
remained intact even when it had fallen into the hands of Tartars,
Mongols, and Manchus. It had returned to the bases of its
former greatness, and the administrative machinery created since
the day of the Shih Huang Ti continued for twenty centuries.
With the decrepitude of the Manchu dynasty, and the simultaneous
collision with the Western world, the old political system
broke and had to be reshaped into new forms. Nevertheless,
even in the Republican era techniques of the T'ang have reappeared
in the administration of government services.</p>

<p>Underneath all shifts there remained a series of social groupings
which were affected far less than were the broad and conspicuous
central regimes. They have existed since the times before
organized government, and may well be sufficiently strong
to set the conditions under which any government or any race of
rulers will succeed or fail in China.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Family, Village, and Hui</a></em></p>

<p>The ideological control in old China operated through those
groups most closely attached to the individual. The government
was not one of them. The fundamental strength of Chinese
society rests upon the cohesion and power of three outstanding
quasi-political agencies: the family system, the village and district,
and the <em>hui</em> (associations, leagues, societies or guilds.)<sup><a href="#fn107" id="r107">15</a></sup></p>

<p>The family was an intricate structure, "composed of a plurality
of kin alignments into four families: the natural family, the
economic family, the religious family, and the sib."<sup><a href="#fn108" id="r108">16</a></sup> The
natural family corresponded to the family of the West. The economic
family commonly extended through several degrees of
kinship, and may have included from thirty to one hundred
individuals, who formed a single economic unit, living collectively.
The religious family was an aggregate of economic
families; it would be difficult to give any specified number of
constituent families as an average. This unit provided the
organization for the proper commemoration and reverence of
ancestors and maintained an ancestral shrine where the genealogical
records were kept; the cult feature has largely disappeared
in modern times. The sib resembled the clan as found in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_137" title="pg 137"> </a>
West; its role was determined by the immediate environment.
In some cases, especially in the South, the sib was powerful
enough to engage in feuds; at times one or more sibs dominated
whole communities. In the greater part of China it was a loose
organization, holding meetings from time to time to unite the
various local religious families which constituted it.</p>

<p>Family consciousness played its part in sustaining certain
elements of the Confucian ideology. It stressed the idea of the
carnal immortality of the human race. It oriented the individual
not only philosophically but socially as well. The size
of each family determined his position spatially, and family
continuity fixed a definite location in time for him. With its
many-handed grasp upon the individual, the family system held
him securely in place and prevented his aspiring to the arrogant
heights of nobility or falling into the degradation of a slavery
in which he might become a mere commodity. A Chinese
surrounded by his kinsmen was shielded against humiliations
inflicted upon him by outsiders and against the menace of his
own potential follies. It was largely through the family system,
with its religious as well as economic and social foundation, that
the Chinese counteracted undesirable mobility of individuals
in a society stable as a whole. Stability thus obtained a clear
and undeniable purpose&mdash;the continued generation of the human
race through the continuity of innumerable families, each
determined upon survival. A materialistic interpretation would
point out the need for cheap and plentiful human labor in maintaining
the agrarian economy of China, and reduce the rationale
of the system to a mere web of justifications.</p>

<p>The family was equaled if not excelled in importance by the
village.<sup><a href="#fn109" id="r109">17</a></sup> Had the family been the only vital social grouping,
it might have been impossible for democratic processes to
develop in China. The family pattern provided, indeed, the
model for the government, but the influence of villages in Chinese
life mitigated the familistic tendencies of government. It would
have been heresy to revolt against an unrighteous father; but
there was nothing to prevent the deposition of an evil village
elder. In times of contentment, the emperor was the father of
the society; at other times he might be looked upon as a fellow
villager subject to the criticism of the people. The village was
the largest working unit of local self-government; it, and the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_138" title="pg 138"> </a>
groups within it, such as the sib, was almost completely autonomous
and subject to outside interference only in very rare cases.
At the same time, the village was the smallest unit of district
organization. The District Magistrate, as the government
officer in charge of a district containing from one to twenty
villages, relied on the village leaders in performing the duties
imposed upon him. Village government was at times very
democratic.<sup><a href="#fn110" id="r110">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Next in importance was the <em>hui</em>. It was in all probability
the last to appear. Neither ordained, as the family seemed to
be, by the eternal physical and biological order of things, nor
made to seem natural, as was the village, by the geographic
and economic environment, this association emerged from the
Chinese propensity toward cooperation. Paralleling and supplementing
family and village, the <em>hui</em> won for itself an unchallenged
place in the Chinese social structure. The <em>hui</em> may be classified
into six categories<sup><a href="#fn111" id="r111">19</a></sup>: (1) fraternal societies; (2) insurance groups;
(3) economic guilds; (4) religious societies; (5) political societies;
and (6) militia and vigilante organizations. The <em>hui</em> made up
the greater part of the economic organization of old China, and
offered vocational education to men not destined for literature
and administration. Under such names as the Triad and
the Lotus the <em>hui</em> provided the party organizations of old China
and challenged the dynasties whenever resentment was ripe.</p>

<p>The old Chinese society, made up of innumerable families,
villages, and <em>hui</em>, comprised the whole "known world." Its
strength was inexhaustible. Having no one nerve center, the
world society could not be destroyed by the inroads of barbarians
or the ravages of famine, pestilence, and insurrection. The
Confucian ideology continued. At no one time were conditions
so bad as to break the many threads of Chinese culture and to
release a new generation from tradition. Throughout the
centuries education and government continued side by side,
even though dynasties fell and the country was overrun by
conquerors. The absence of any rigid organization of legal
authority facilitated survival, while a certain minimum of order
could be maintained even in the absence of an emperor or,
as more commonly occurred, in the presence of several.</p>

<p>The governmental superstructure kept the Chinese world
together in a formal manner; it did not give it vitality. The
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_139" title="pg 139"> </a>
family, the village, and the <em>hui</em> were fit subjects for imperial
attention, but the emperor could not remove his sanction from
their existence and thereby annihilate them. No precarious
legal personality was attributed to the family, the village, and
the <em>hui</em>, which could be extirpated by a mere edict. It was
possible for the English kings to destroy the Highland clan of
the MacGregor&mdash;"the proscribed name"&mdash;without liquidating
the members of the clan <em>in toto</em>. In China the emperor could
wipe out a family by massacre, but it was practically impossible
for him to destroy an organization without destroying all its
members. On the whole, however, the government of China
pursued its three main ends&mdash;the maintenance of the ideology
(education), the defense of the realm against barbarians (military
affairs) and against adverse forces of nature (public works),
and the collection of funds for the fulfilment of these functions
(revenue).</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Governmental Changes Foreshadowing the Republic</a></em></p>

<p>The pressure of the West compelled the Chinese government to
define more clearly than ever before its own boundaries, its
relations with the vassal states, and its lines of contact with
the Chinese people. By the Treaty of Nerchinsk, negotiated in
1689 with Russia, the Chinese tried to demarcate their land
frontier. The vassal nations presented a crucial problem.
The Chinese failed to make explicit their quasi suzerainty in
terms comprehensible to Western jurisprudence. At the same
time they followed a policy of brisk exaggeration of territorial
rights alternating with outright disclaimer of responsibility.
The scope of government itself was affected by new functions
which arose with the coming of the Westerners. The tax
system was expanded. The development of an imperial customs
service with Western personnel and Western methods of accounting
provided the government with a source of large revenue.
The demands that Western states be given adequate consideration
in the transaction of business led to the establishment in
1860 of the Foreign Office (<em>Tsung-li Yam&ecirc;n</em>), a new institution
which modified the traditional administrative pattern.</p>

<p>In addition, the Western states introduced their own type of
government into China through the demand that their citizens
be subject only to the law with which they were familiar at home.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140" title="pg 140"> </a>
In dealing with Westerners the Chinese had at first employed a
code far more Draconic than the provisions of Chinese penal
practice. After many years of irritation the Western powers,
under the leadership of Great Britain, secured extraterritorial
privileges for their citizens. Extraterritoriality placed Westerners
in China solely under the jurisdiction of their respective
national representatives. If an American today were to shoot
down the Dalai Lama in Tibet, he could be tried legally only
in the United States Court in Shanghai&mdash;although it is improbable
that the Tibetans would insist upon juridical niceties.
Apart from the guarantee of personal immunity from Chinese
law for their citizens, wherever they might be in China, the
Western powers, through a long series of special arrangements
and actual usage, obtained certain footholds on Chinese soil
where even Chinese were under Western rule. These areas
were known as <em>concessions</em> and <em>settlements</em>, and the cities of their
location as the <em>treaty ports</em>. Both the presence of Westerners
subject only to Western law throughout the Empire, and of
areas where Western governance was paramount, taught the
Chinese the lesson of strong government.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. The British-Chinese treaty of Nanking
(1842) and that with the United States (1844) both contained
provisions relating to the protection of the life and property of
foreigners. The imperial government found itself pledged to
the fulfillment of a policy which collided directly with the
xenophobia engendered by ideological control. The enforcement
of these provisions, half-hearted as it was, involved constantly
increasing imperial intervention in regional affairs, although
the issues arising between the central government and the provincial
authorities were settled through negotiation rather than
enforceable commands.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the nineteenth century the gradual transformation
in China gave rise to a reform movement carried forward
by a group of constitutional monarchists. One of their
leaders, K'ang Yu-wei, became in 1898 the tutor of the young
Emperor Kuang Hs&uuml;. The summer of that year witnessed a
steady stream of edicts which ultimately might have made
China under the leadership of the throne as progressive as Japan.
The reforms aimed primarily at efficiency and modernization,
and partially at the parliamentarization of the regime. The
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_141" title="pg 141"> </a>
young Emperor, however, was soon checked by Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai,
his leading military adviser, and outmaneuvered by the reactionary
Empress Dowager. He spent the rest of his life in actual
imprisonment, and the Six Geniuses&mdash;as the reformers behind
his policy were called&mdash;were exiled or executed. One of those
who were put to death was the poet Tan Shih-tung, a man of great
skill in the classical literature and of ambitious visions for the
future, who might, had the Hundred Days succeeded, have lived
to be a guardian of the throne in a modern Chinese Empire.
Just before his execution he wrote the following poem, calling
forth the memory of Chiang-ch'ing and Tou-keng, upright men
of the past, and comparing his faith with the mountain range of
Kuang-l&ecirc;ng:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Last Song from Prison</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="indent"><em>Prison door facing me&mdash;thoughts of Chiang-ch'ing&mdash;</em></li>
<li class="indent"><em>I could die easily, if like Tou-keng ...</em></li>
<li class="indent"><em>Laughing and alone, I lift the knife to heaven:</em></li>
<li class="indent"><em>I die but leave behind hopes higher than Kuang-l&ecirc;ng!</em><sup><a href="#fn112" id="r112">20</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Reform, indeed, could not be downed. The Manchu dynasty
itself began to tread cautiously in the footsteps of Japan. In
1905 an agency was set up for the purpose of studying various
foreign forms of government and of making recommendations
for the modernization of the imperial government. In 1908 a
draft constitution, very similar to the constitution of the Japanese
Empire, was approved. A nine-year program, from 1908 to
1916 inclusive, was to lead to constitutional, parliamentary
monarchy&mdash;if parliamentary monarchy be regarded merely as a
monarchy with a parliament appended. The principle of cabinet
responsibility to parliament was not established, and from the
very beginning the Manchus, less wise than the ruling house in
Japan, not only failed to grant sufficient powers on paper but
began packing the quasi-parliamentary institutions before they
were set up. Hand-picked, the preliminary National Assembly
which met in 1909 began wrangling with the Throne.<sup><a href="#fn113" id="r113">21</a></sup> The old
Empress Dowager had died in the preceding year; so had the
imprisoned Emperor Kuang Hs&uuml;. The new Emperor was
an infant, and the court was little more than a gathering of
bewildered Manchu princes listening to the advice of the eunuchs
and palace officials.<sup><a href="#fn114" id="r114">22</a></sup> Reform from above, had there been a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_142" title="pg 142"> </a>
single man of will and courage to take charge of it, might have
had considerable chances of success. But while the Manchus
tinkered with the superstructure of government, the foundations
of society were washing away beneath their feet. More was
involved than the improvement of administrative technique
and the illusion of popular representation. A political and social
revolution was in the making. Sun Yat-sen was the man who,
more than any other single person, shaped its course.</p>

<p>In 1893 Sun had gone north to advocate reform and present a
petition to Li Hung-chang, an eminent imperial statesman.<sup><a href="#fn115" id="r115">23</a></sup>
The mission failed. In 1897 Sun was willing to speak openly
of revolution. He refrained, however, from advocating a republic
before Western audiences, even though his party was committed
to it. He wrote in his book <em>Kidnapped in London</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The prime essence of the movement was the establishment of a form
of constitutional government to supplement the old-fashioned, corrupt,
and worn-out system under which China is groaning.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter into details as to what form of rule obtains
in China at present. It may be summed up, however, in a few words.
The people have no say whatever in the management of Imperial,
National, or even Municipal affairs. The mandarins, or local magistrates,
have full power of adjudication, from which there is no appeal.
Their word is law, and they have full scope to practice their machinations
with irresponsibility, and every officer may fatten himself with impunity.
Extortion by officials is an institution; it is the condition on which they
take office; and it is only when the bleeder is a bungler that the government
steps in with pretended benevolence to ameliorate but more often
to complete the depletion....</p>

<p>This official thief, with his mind warped by his mode of life, is the
ultimate authority in all matters of social, political, and criminal
life....<sup><a href="#fn116" id="r116">24</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1905 Sun Yat-sen lashed out at the monarchical reformers,
subjecting their motives to vigorous criticism:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since the Boxer war many have been led to believe that the Tartar
[Manchu or Ch'ing government] is beginning to see the sign of time
and to reform itself for the betterment of the country, just from the
occasional ... edicts ... not knowing that they are mere dead letters
made for the express purpose of pacifying popular agitations. It is
absolutely impossible for the Manchus to reform the country because
reformation means detriment to them. By reformation they would be
absorbed by the Chinese people and would lose the special rights and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_143" title="pg 143"> </a>
privileges which they are enjoying. The still darker side of the government
can be seen when the ignorance and corruptness of the official
class are brought to light. These fossilized, rotten, good-for-nothing
officials know only how to flatter and bribe the Manchus, whereby their
position may be strengthened to carry on the trade of squeezing [graft].<sup><a href="#fn117" id="r117">25</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>He also insisted that China's difficulties could be solved only
by the establishment of a republic, which he envisaged with
great optimism:</p>

<blockquote><p>A new, enlightened and progressive government must be substituted
in place of the old one; in such a case China would not only be able to
support herself but would also relieve the other countries of the trouble
of maintaining her independence and integrity. There are many highly
educated and able men among the people who would be competent to
take up the task of forming a new government, and carefully thought-out
plans have long been drawn up for the transformation of this ...
Tartar monarchy into a Republic of China. The ... masses of the
people are also ready to accept the new order of things and are longing
for a change for better to uplift them from their ... deplorable condition
of life. China is now on the eve of a great national movement, for
just a spark of light would set the whole political forest on fire to drive
out the Tartar from our land. Our task is indeed great but it will not
be an impossible one....<sup><a href="#fn118" id="r118">26</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Sun's diagnosis of the situation was remarkably correct; he
clearly sensed the coming Republic whose first president he was
to become seven years later. The ideological revolution was
already under way, and the Empire about to dissolve into
the past. What neither Sun nor anyone else realized was that
ahead of China there lay government problems more serious
than misrule. The ideological shift had terminated the reality
of the old regime, and the military conditions were favorable;
but would men be ready to invest their faith durably in a new
order?</p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> VII</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">THE REVOLUTION</a></h2>


<p>On October 9, 1911, a follower of Sun Yat-sen, one of the heroic
and desperate "Dare-to-dies" who had harassed the imperial
government for years, was working over a bomb in the Russian
concession in the upriver port of Hankow. The bomb exploded
accidentally; the secret storage of munitions was discovered;
the next day, in the ensuing turmoil, the Republic of China was
born. Double Ten Day (October 10, 1911) has since been
celebrated as the Chinese Fourth of July. When the imperial
officials sought to suppress the insurrection, they uncovered a
conspiracy in the ranks of their own troops; in self-protection
the troops revolted. In the next two months the Manchu Empire
crumbled away. Sun Yat-sen, who was in Chicago at the time
of the outbreak,<sup><a href="#fn119" id="r119">1</a></sup> could trust his organization. Sure that
destiny was working with him, he took his leisure in returning to
China and stopped in London to forestall financial aid to the
collapsing Empire.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Presidency of Sun Yat-sen and the Republican Revolution</a></em></p>

<p>The fall of the Empire was not the result of a great mass
movement agitating the whole population; it developed from the
revolutionary nucleus which Sun and his followers had built
up to secure power. They had hammered away at the imperial
regime by instigating mutiny and terror for many years, since
they realized that the incompetence of the government was
matched only by its impotence. The revolution itself was a
chain of rebellions, occurring province by province under the
leadership of revolutionaries or officials joining the revolution.
Except for the massacre of Manchus in some of the cities, it was
a nearly bloodless revolution. However, the various groups
pushed in different directions, and different men tried to seize
power. The constitutional monarchists compelled the throne
to issue a very liberal constitution, which might be accepted by
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_146" title="pg 146"> </a>
the populace in place of the Republican programs. Military
men began to come to the fore, as the army units alone were in
a position of unchallengeable power. Men who had no thought
of revolution might join it in time to become leaders of the revolutionary-military
juntas. Li Y&uuml;an-hung, an officer of the
Empire, hid under his bed when revolutionary soldiers sought
him out; given the choice between death and adherence to the
revolutionaries, he sided with the new powers, and in a short while
became the commanding officer of the revolutionary forces in the
Wu-han cities. Similar instances were not uncommon.</p>

<p>The revolutionaries managed to call together representatives
of their party and of the troops to a National Convention at
Nanking. They were seriously handicapped by the absence of
Sun Yat-sen, who now hastened back to China from London.
Few of the members of the revolutionary group&mdash;heretofore
forced to operate as a secret society&mdash;were well enough known
to have the prestige needed to form a new government. Huang
Hsing, Sun's chief military follower, sought to manage in the
interim, but not until the arrival of Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai
on December 24, 1911, was there a prospect of consolidation.
Five days later the National Convention elected him president
of the Provisional Government of the United Provinces. On
January 1, 1912, he took office; with the adoption of the Gregorian
calendar now in use, this date became the first day of the Year
I of the Chinese Republic. With the presidency there was
created a cabinet, whose ministers did not yet hold any specific
portfolios. The portions of the country under revolutionary
control were ruled for the time being by a temporary system
which combined the military and civilian governments in each
province.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Empire was still the internationally recognized
government of China and continued to function in Peking.
Thoroughly frightened, the imperial court saw no alternative
to calling into its service the one man who could be expected
to master the situation&mdash;Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai, who had ruthlessly
terminated the experiment of the Hundred Days in 1898 and
whipped up the first effective modern army of the Empire.
Y&uuml;an, who had fallen into disfavor as a result of court machinations
a few years before, waited his time, receiving offers from
both sides. Finally he went to Peking, on October 27, 1911.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_147" title="pg 147"> </a></p>

<p>The negotiations which ensued over the establishment of a new
government and the pacification of the country brought into
the spotlight two of the outstanding personalities of modern
China&mdash;men whose characters were to mold the institutions in a
highly plastic society and whose influences were to last beyond
their deaths. Sun Yat-sen, a Cantonese with many overseas
connections, stood outside the old-style elite&mdash;a constitutionalist
and an idealist. Y&uuml;an was a soldier and diplomat from the
North, narrow in outlook, altogether a tradition-bound official
despite his up-to-date military ideas&mdash;an opportunist and a
realist in politics. Rarely have two leaders represented such
opposite extremes.</p>

<p>In the conclusion of the negotiations Y&uuml;an played a part which
would have filled Machiavelli with admiration. The imperial
family was cajoled into taking the baby Emperor off the throne
but was at the same time wheedled into refusing outright abdication.
The edicts of February 12, 1912, are among the most
curious state papers of modern times. They turned over
"the power of government" to Y&uuml;an, admitted the faults of the
dynasty, and ordered him to negotiate with the revolutionists
and establish a Republic of China. Nothing was said about
any eventual resumption of power by the dynasty, although
provision was to be made for the comfort and dignity of the court.
The Manchu house was to retain the Forbidden City (imperial
palace) in Peking, where the monarch could continue to exercise
his functions, freed from the cares of government.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen indignantly repudiated any idea that the Republic
derived from a formal authorization extended by the hated
Manchus&mdash;the Republic for which he and his revolutionists had
struggled for decades. But he held his peace, unwilling to upset
the chances of national unification on a point of form. Y&uuml;an
was recognized as an able man, although he lacked trustworthiness
and intellectual ability; it seemed possible to make use of
him and simultaneously to satisfy him by giving him a position
within the Republican framework. After the edicts of abdication,
the issue became one of ultra-idealist constitutionalism
versus brutal military realism.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Sun should keep the provisional presidency
until Y&uuml;an could be inaugurated as president. Under the circumstances
it was the only possible course. Y&uuml;an possessed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_148" title="pg 148"> </a>
decisive military power, and there could have been no hope of
bending him. Furthermore, Sun actually did not wish the office
of president. He realized that his own strength was that of
ideologue and leader and felt that by enforcing his principle
of <em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em><sup><a href="#fn120" >2</a></sup> he could serve China best.</p>

<p>Y&uuml;an, it was arranged, was to come south to the new capital
at Nanking. This was something which he had no desire to do,
as the city was in the hands of the revolutionists and his army
was in the north. When he was pressed to take office, he engineered
a military mutiny in the Peking area, which did enormous
property damage and gave him an adequate excuse for remaining
where he was. By thus forcing the government to establish itself
at Peking, he followed out the spirit of the imperial abdication
edict and brought the Republican regime to the very city in
which the Emperor still lived, and in which the imperial bureaucracy
awaited its new Republican garments&mdash;socially and
ideologically the stronghold of resourceful reaction. There
was thus no problem of creating a new modern administration.
The old Peking mandarinate continued, and the revolutionary
Republicans came into the government offices as strangers
intruding into a closed system. For the initial months of the
Republican experiment Peking's novel status was merely the
evidence of Y&uuml;an's prestige; thereafter, Peking was to become
the embodiment of archaism, blind pragmatism, and corruption.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1912, Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai took a solemn oath to
preserve and defend the Republic and assumed office as president.
On the same day a Provisional Constitution went into effect,
whereby the National Convention placed the greater share
of government power in the hands of a National Council, to
serve until the promulgation of election laws for the choice of a
national parliament. Republican mistrust of Y&uuml;an was evident
in this action. Yet Sun Yat-sen was satisfied that his first
principle, nationalism, had been realized in great part by the
expulsion of the Manchus, and that his second, democracy, was
in the process of fulfillment. He turned to the realization of
the third, <em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em>.<sup><a href="#fn120" id="r120">2</a></sup> Y&uuml;an placed him in charge of all railway
development in China, and Sun cherished the freedom to carry
out the practical aspect of the revolution. He had passed beyond
the stage of agitation and conspiracy, of wandering about in
the world, his life in year-long daily jeopardy, seeking men and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_149" title="pg 149"> </a>
funds for a revolution which seemed Utopian to most. Now
he could do his work quietly, without inducing simple merchants
and workers to risk sudden death or the torture racks of the Board
of Punishments. He had no way of realizing that his miraculous
success was to be followed by defeat and that the revolution
for which he had fought was not over but had only begun.</p>

<p>The presidency of Sun Yat-sen in Nanking, terminated by
Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai's assumption of office, was little more than a
military and revolutionary junta linking together the various
provincial revolutionary groups. It had to face no serious
problems of administration, and the collection of taxes was the
last thing that a brand-new revolutionary government would
dare to stress in China. Its principles were republican, but it
inaugurated no formal institutions and resorted to no elections,
referenda, or plebiscites. The task of constituting democracy in
China was placed under the stewardship of the most versatile
military opportunist of the age: Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Parliamentary Republic</a></em></p>

<p>After Sun Yat-sen relinquished the presidency to Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai
and the Republican regime settled down in the citadel of the old
regime, a form of government was set up which did not immediately
reveal itself as patently unworkable but which in retrospect
seems a curiously ill-conceived experiment in transplanting
institutions. Sun and his followers assumed that democratic,
parliamentary institutions were adaptable, that the existing
grouping would soon lend itself to the purpose of effective multi-party
government, and that parties would arise organically
from honest differences of opinion. They considered the
republicanization of the provincial and local governments of
less immediate importance than the establishment of a national
democratic order. They expected to have a constitutional
government with the five "races" of China&mdash;Chinese, Mongol,
Manchu, Tibetan, and Turkic (Mohammedan)&mdash;united under
the new five-barred banner. At the time, these assumptions
seemed practicable.</p>

<p>The Provisional Constitution of March, 1912, established a
relatively weak presidency though with somewhat greater
powers than the French. Article 45 required the countersignature
of all presidential orders by the appropriate cabinet
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_150" title="pg 150"> </a>
minister; the ministers were to be appointed by the president
with the concurrence of the legislative. Unfortunately, the
principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament was not
explicitly stated, although it might have been expected that the
far-reaching powers of the legislative body would have led to
actual parliamentarism very shortly. It was obviously the
intention of the Republicans to promote Y&uuml;an to a position of
ineffectiveness. The premier and the cabinet selected by the
president with legislative concurrence were to be subject to
interpellation. On the other hand, they were granted the
privilege of speaking in the legislative body (Articles 43-47).
The unicameral National Council (<em>ts'an-i-y&uuml;an</em>)&mdash;to continue
only until the election of the legislative body&mdash;was to be constituted
in the following manner, under Article 18:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Provinces, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Tibet shall each elect
and depute five members to the National Council, and Ch'inghai
[Kokonor] shall elect one member.</p>

<p>The electoral districts and methods of election shall be decided by
the localities concerned.<sup><a href="#fn121" id="r121">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of this procedural latitude, the delegates to the
National Council were either elected by the provincial assemblies
or appointed by the military governors or came with no formal
credentials whatever. All officials were ordered to continue
in their posts. The revolutionists still exerted control over large
military bodies in the South and held many of the provinces
under their military leaders or juntas, so that Y&uuml;an proceeded
cautiously in the creation of his first administration. He
chose personalities acceptable to the revolutionists, but appointed
no outstanding men of Sun's Tung M&ecirc;ng Hui.</p>

<p>The parliamentary system looked well enough on the surface,
but the basis of government had disappeared and the problem
of mass democracy was more fundamental than anyone then
imagined. Many groups in the country began organizing as
parties; Y&uuml;an himself appeared to further the new way. But
he had his own thoughts. He ordered his followers to enter the
revolutionary units to undermine them, and simultaneously
pushed for the establishment of a party of his own. There
was on all sides a pathetic eagerness to live up to the formal
expectations of the Western world. Tragically, this government
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" title="pg 151"> </a>
was comic opera. Y&uuml;an began having skirmishes with the
Council within a few months. The Republicans allowed the
actual power to slip away from them while seeking to exercise
the authority derived from a constitution which most citizens
of the new Republic could not understand at all. In the summer
of 1912 Sun Yat-sen's followers began to face a definitely hostile
executive. The Council looked for redress but found that
parliamentary tricks turned easily against it. The conservative
members, supporting Y&uuml;an, walked out, and the Council lacked
a quorum.</p>

<p>In August, 1912, the old revolutionary organization of Sun
Yat-sen, founded by his coordination of earlier secret societies,
was transformed into a regular party, the Kuomintang.
The Kuomintang devoted themselves to the development of
genuine party government; looking upon the Republic as their
own creation, they were less ready for compromise than Chinese
usage might have required. This did not improve the position
of Sun's adherents. Y&uuml;an countered by forming the Progressive
Party (<em>Chinputang</em>). While both sides lost control over the
people, the party system was not even important enough to
amount to carpetbagging. The only power in the country, as
doctrine and administration melted away, was the military.<sup><a href="#fn122" id="r122">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Under the terms of the Provisional Constitution the Council
was to yield to a bicameral National Assembly, for which it should
provide by law within ten months. It was to be the duty of
the National Assembly to prepare a permanent constitution
(Articles 53 and 54). In the summer of 1912 the Council passed
the required law, providing for the indirect election of a Senate
and the direct election, by a limited electorate and under a
very complicated electoral scheme,<sup><a href="#fn123" id="r123">5</a></sup> of a House of Representatives.
About 1/35 of 1 per cent of the total population voted. The
Kuomintang came out far ahead of any other party, with a
definite plurality but one insufficient to give it absolute control
of the Assembly, which met early in 1913. Inexperienced even
in the elementary requirements of parliamentary practice, let
alone the conduct of government, the legislative branch was
destined to be sheer ornament. The Kuomintang had relegated
themselves to the occupancy of the least important branch of
the government. The new parliament met amid great theatricals
and placed heavy emphasis on form but was unable to make its
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_152" title="pg 152"> </a>
will felt. The quarrels with the President over foreign loans,
democratic policy and party rule were not settled by a showdown,
but by resort to technicalities on both sides.</p>

<p>Y&uuml;an, however, had his finger on the trigger. March, 1913,
was marked by the murder of Sung Chiao-j&ecirc;n, one of the ablest
of Sun's followers. It was the first political act to indicate that
Y&uuml;an was embarking upon a program of assassinations. Even
upon this occasion, Sun Yat-sen held his hand, ready to let the
new regime prove its character. Y&uuml;an used the waiting spell
to replace Kuomintang men in the provincial armies and governments
with his own adherents. In July, 1913, a second revolution
broke out. It was a move of self-defense on the part of the
Republicans, followers of Sun. The revolution was suppressed
by Y&uuml;an.</p>

<p>Undisturbed, the work of constitution drafting proceeded
apace in the North. Again, the trend, paradoxically, was
toward French precedent. The paradox became patent when
Y&uuml;an forced the advance adoption of the provisions relating to
the presidency; on October 10, 1913, the Assembly elected him
president of the Republic. This gave him full <em>de jure</em> status
as head of the Chinese state in the eyes of the foreign powers.
On November 4 Y&uuml;an suppressed the party which had created
the Republic, the Kuomintang. This not only eliminated
serious opposition to him but paralyzed the Assembly as well. It
was left without a quorum and without a constitution under
which a new Assembly could be elected&mdash;one of the most surprising
constitutional cul-de-sacs in modern times. The dictatorship
began.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Presidential Dictatorship of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai</a></em></p>

<p>Not content with having immobilized the National Assembly,
Y&uuml;an proceeded to kill it. He called together an extraconstitutional
body of his supporters, known as the Political Council.
It recommended two measures: the dissolution of the National
Assembly and the calling of a Constitutional Council to frame a
permanent constitution. On January 10, 1914, Y&uuml;an suspended
the Assembly by presidential decree. With that day the Chinese
Republic ceased to have a government consonant with its laws.
Technically the whole Republic lapsed into unconstitutionality
and illegality, until it was swept out of existence by the National
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_153" title="pg 153"> </a>
Government in 1928.<sup><a href="#fn124" id="r124">6</a></sup> Nevertheless, the military leaders had
sufficient belief in the political value of twentieth century
formalities to preserve the appearance of constitutional procedure.
During the following months Y&uuml;an's Constitutional
Council, which succeeded the Political Council and was, similarly,
made up of persons favorable to his rule, labored over another
constitutional document. On May 1, 1914, the document
was promulgated under the name <em>Constitutional Compact</em>. The
Compact changed the style of Y&uuml;an's rule from a nominal
parliamentarism to presidential government, and legitimatized
the dictatorship.</p>

<p>Two and a half years after the establishment of the Republic,
the country had grown accustomed to the rule of Y&uuml;an. His
government had the advantage of carrying on from the seat of
the former imperial administration. Y&uuml;an's peculiar faculties
of old-school diplomacy and his grasp of modern militarism stood
him in good stead. The Republic was generally admitted to be
not much of a democracy, but even democratic Westerners
applauded the hard-headed competence of the "strong man of
China." Government was more efficient and more despotic
than it had been in the last days of the Manchu dynasty; resistance
and defiance did not take open forms, except for the activities
of Sun Yat-sen and his followers, who had reverted to
revolutionary tactics since the outlawry of their party. Their
agitation was spreading with rapidity. Y&uuml;an made the same
mistake the Republicans had made before: he failed to sink the
roots of government into the minds of the people and to provide
a coherent explanation for his own existence. Underestimating
the change which had taken place, Y&uuml;an sustained the illusion
that the Chinese society in which he was reared still existed.
While he failed to evolve a symbolism emphasizing the rise of a
new order with him as the head, the realization that the old
Empire was gone was allowed to spread slowly across China.
There was no more throne; the child Emperor dwelt quietly
in his museum.</p>

<p>In 1915 Y&uuml;an embarked upon one of the strangest exploits in
modern Chinese politics. After prostituting the democratic
formulas in accordance with which he professed to govern, he
began to use the same formulas for a cautious approach to the
creation of a new monarchy. He was partly encouraged by a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_154" title="pg 154"> </a>
memorandum presented to him on August 9, 1915, by his constitutional
adviser, Professor Frank Goodnow. The memorandum
suggested, as a sane political theorem, the desirability
of establishing a constitutional monarchy <em>if</em> there was general
demand for it rather than of maintaining the trappings of
Republicanism without operative democracy. But Y&uuml;an's
scheming met with strong opposition. Both sides to the ensuing
monarchical controversy misconstrued Professor Goodnow's
memorandum; Y&uuml;an's foes denounced it even as a recommendation
for autocracy. Seen from a purely institutional point of
view, there was no harm in the proposal. A disadvantage might
lie in the fact that other military leaders would be jealous of
Y&uuml;an's obtaining the throne on which so many of them speculated.
If the state of mind of the Chinese and the new doctrines
of the Republicans are considered, the proposal becomes less
feasible. Having gone through the terrific mental and moral
jolt of a fundamental shift of living forms, and having realized
that the Empire was irrecoverable, substantial sections of the
population were in no mood to allow an untried Republic to be
superseded by an even less tried modern military monarchy.</p>

<p>Y&uuml;an used Japan's Twenty-one Demands of 1915, which
might have made China a quasi protectorate of Japan, as an
argument for the immediate necessity of strengthening the central
government. In sponsoring the movement for monarchy
he virtually copied the procedure of Napoleon III in establishing
the Second Empire. The whole technique of modern usurpation
was brought into play, and no one stopped to consider who might
be impressed by it. The only audience which might have taken
at their face value Y&uuml;an's carefully staged "popular demonstrations"
and his recommendations for "representative" public
bodies was the Western public outside. Chinese familiar enough
with elections to understand their meaning were for a Republic;
the Chinese who did not understand them were not
impressed.</p>

<p>Had China possessed a man with the administrative and
military talents of George Washington, a genuine republic might
have developed from beneath the tutelage of a strong military
ruler. Sun Yat-sen, because of his Southern birth, his thoroughly
revolutionary tenets, and his impatience with the jobbery of
petty politics, was not prepared for the presidential office in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_155" title="pg 155"> </a>
Peking. He might have headed a revolutionary government
elsewhere in China but not a carry-over administration in
Peking. Y&uuml;an misjudged his own opportunities and went back
to the ritual of the Empire in an endeavor to place himself on
a widely coveted throne. In December, 1915, after a circus of
plebiscites and constitutional councils had been provided, the
constitutional monarchy was proclaimed. In the same month
Y&uuml;an performed the ancient ceremonials of the Imperial Sacrifice
to Heaven, clad in the traditional gowns of the emperor. On
Christmas Day, 1915, the province of Y&uuml;nnan&mdash;in the extreme
southwest of China&mdash;revolted against Y&uuml;an. The revolt spread,
and in March, 1916, Y&uuml;an renounced the throne. His dream
had come to a dismal end; he died on June 6, 1916. In the
same month Vice-President Li Y&uuml;an-hung&mdash;the imperial officer
whose political career began when he was dragged from beneath
his bed in 1911&mdash;assumed the title of president. The National
Assembly was convoked. The Provisional Constitution was put
into effect again. And, as a sign of the times, the provincial
military commanders took the new title <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> in place of the
older version <em>tutu</em>.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Phantom Republic in Peking</a></em></p>

<p>When the Manchu Empire fell in 1911-1912, it left the military
power to Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai, who cloaked it with the Republic which
he appropriated. When Y&uuml;an died, control of the armies passed
to the provincial military commandants whom he had installed
as a prime feature of his "strong man" regime. With the
passing of the Empire, civilian bureaucracy fell into disuse yet
retained just enough cohesion to serve the purposes of Y&uuml;an, so
far as they were to be served by government. After Y&uuml;an's
death, the governments in the provinces followed the flow of
power&mdash;to the provincial commanders. The Indian summer
of the parliamentary Republic was founded upon its toleration
of the army system which Y&uuml;an had left standing in its fragments.
The weight of power was now to go into these fragments and
not into the Republic, which fell heir merely to Y&uuml;an's naive
and almost contemptuously conceived "constitutional" show.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen was favorable to the newly restored Republic
but did not participate in it, since it was made up largely of
second-string revolutionists&mdash;men who had joined when the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_156" title="pg 156"> </a>
cause was winning in 1911&mdash;with a sprinkling of his own followers,
together with a substantial cohort of the new-style military.
Sun had been in exile in Japan during Y&uuml;an's regime, sounding
out the possibility of Japanese assistance in furthering his
movement. Without the participation of any group competent
to attract ideological support to civilian government, and without
any one military leader able to serve or master its cause, the
Republic had to rest upon the administrative structure. Its
power was virtually nil. The legislative, as in the early days
of the Republic, was dominated by Sun's revolutionary Republicans,
the executive by a conservative cabal of soldiers. The
situation differed from the earlier one in that the military leader
from the North, T&uuml;an Chi-jui, occupied the post of premier
instead of that of president. Within a year the fundamental
contradictions in the regime displayed themselves. T&uuml;an
quarreled with the President and the Assembly, demanding
dissolution of the latter. Not obtaining what he wished, he
joined in 1917 other military chieftains in forming a provisional
military junta in Tientsin. The President called in for his support
the most reactionary army man of all, Chang Hs&uuml;n. Chang
forced the dissolution of the Assembly, the very contingency
he was supposed to prevent. He capped this act by restoring
the Manchu dynasty and putting the boy ex-Emperor Hs&uuml;an
T'ung back on the throne (July 1, 1917).</p>

<p>While the country was startled to learn of the restoration of
the dynasty, and to receive edicts by telegraph issued in the name
of Hs&uuml;an T'ung, forces of opposition began to gather. The
restoration lasted until the Northern military leaders could
catch their breaths; on July 12 T&uuml;an Chi-jui marched back into
Peking to prevent Chang Hs&uuml;n from stealing a march on him.
The unfortunate ex-Emperor was promptly deposed for the
second time. He was not to be put on a throne again until he
became the Emperor of Manchoukuo in 1934.</p>

<p>At this juncture the arena was to broaden. In October, 1917,
Sun Yat-sen was elected Generalissimo of the South by the
remnants of the parliament which had gathered in Canton.
Their action was provoked largely by China's declaration of war
on Germany&mdash;a step which Sun bitterly opposed as serving no
Chinese interest. From now on there were to be <em>two</em> Republican
traditions in China, each one of them with theoretical claims to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_157" title="pg 157"> </a>
the legitimate succession from the 1912-1913 Republic. The
government established by Sun Yat-sen in the South did not
secure any international recognition, nor did it contain remnants
of the imperial bureaucracy, or win the respect of the soldiery.
But it did fall heir to the ideological revolution. The people
were still skeptically indulgent toward Sun the idealist and his
ramshackle governments, although they conceived of government
in China largely as the problem of fattening the Peking phantom
and raising it to husky manhood. The Northern Republic
survived until 1928, increasingly a puzzle and an illusion.<sup><a href="#fn125" id="r125">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The details of its slow death are intricate. The military did
not ignore the Republic altogether. They requested its sanction
for their manipulation of the balance of power. The Republic
legitimized the gradations of military strength which grew out
of conspiracy, tax exploitation, opium farming, and ineffectual
war. The Republic and its presidency were the chief pawns in
the pointless game of Chinese militarism. The Republic lent
a color of unity to the country and preserved those proprieties
dominant in the Chinese mind. Even banditry becomes
respectable if it observes "political" formalities, and at times
the line between banditry and generalship became a matter of
day-to-day intentions or of the size of the armed forces at hand.
The government in Peking struggled to provide a suitable
organizational form for the status quo, though never quite catching
up with the new <em>faits accomplis</em> of each week.</p>

<p>In three connections the Republic of China at Peking is worthy
of consideration: in its constitutional development, which in a
dreamlike and ineffectual way mirrored the political ideals of
the nonrevolutionary elite;<sup><a href="#fn126" id="r126">8</a></sup> in its international role, which was of
genuine importance and value to China; and in its administrative
accomplishments, which&mdash;for a government&mdash;were negligible to
the point of absurdity, but admirable indeed for bureaucracy
working in chaos.</p>

<p>The Peking government was technically based on the Provisional
Constitution of 1912. At the earliest period of the
restored Republic (1917) it fell into the hands of the Anfu
clique, which administered to China a dose of Reconstruction
on the American model. The treasury was literally looted,
and the politicos who attached themselves to the government
and to the military dominating it fell over each other in their
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_158" title="pg 158"> </a>
haste to sell the nation out to Japan. A peace conference with
the representatives of the South met in 1919 but accomplished
nothing. A new parliament was chosen from the areas claimed
by Peking; when this passed out of existence another parliament
stemming from the National Assembly dissolved by Y&uuml;an in
1913 assembled in 1922&mdash;a rare modern instance of a legislative
body succeeding its successors. This so-called Old Parliament
returned to the task which had been interrupted ten years
before and in 1923 gave birth to a constitution.</p>

<p>The 1923 constitution&mdash;China's third Republican constitution,
after the Provisional Constitution of 1912 and the Constitutional
Compact of 1914&mdash;was adopted by a body revoltingly corrupt.
The constitution itself was the work of political scientists; it was
as admirable a document as John Locke's constitution for the
colony of Carolina, although the parliament elected Ts'ao Kun
president under conditions which set a record for indefensible
practices. The constitution itself was federalist, but with many
adaptations of French institutions in so far as the central government
was concerned. As a theoretical device for government,
it would stand high among the constitutions of the world, but
if not stillborn it was never brought to life. Within a year it
was set aside, and another provisional system of government was
established. A committee was set to work on a fourth constitution
more strongly federal.<sup><a href="#fn127" id="r127">9</a></sup> The provisional government
lasted from 1924 to 1926. In 1926 Chang Tso-lin, the <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> of
Manchuria, took over the city of Peking and the government. In
doing so he did not bother to appoint a constitutional committee
or to bribe a parliament. He appointed himself dictator (<em>ta
y&uuml;an shuai</em>) and let the legalistic logicians construe it as they
might. On June 5, 1928, Sun Yat-sen's armies from the
South occupied Peking, and the Peking Republic was at an end.
A ghost of a ghost, it was to reappear as a Japanese device in 1937,
at a time when constitutional debate was at a minimum.</p>

<p>From the metamorphoses of the Peking Republic the Chinese
learned most bitterly the lessons of political reality. It dawned
upon them that government would have to rest upon foundations
reaching deep into society and could not be superimposed upon
the existing disorder. Their constitutional experience also
satiated the Chinese with Western formalism. Yet the phantom
governments at Peking enjoyed the full recognition of the Great
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_159" title="pg 159"> </a>
Powers, and the Waichiaopu (Foreign Office) maintained an
impeccable diplomatic front. Although the Chinese scored no
triumph at the Paris peace conference, they came off much
better than they would have done without any representation.
Three years later, at the Washington Conference, the Chinese,
favored by the jealousies prevailing between the other powers,
won a notable diplomatic victory. Representing a government
whose authority scarcely reached beyond its own capital and
whose limited financial resources threw its diplomatic corps
largely on their own, the members of the Chinese delegation
secured advantages for China greater than any won at the time
by the Soviet Union.<sup><a href="#fn128" id="r128">10</a></sup></p>

<p>In the international field the Chinese owed their strength to
the same factors that weakened them at home: careful attention
to form, the anxious cherishing of prestige and appearance, and a
limitless patience which did not predispose the diplomats to
violent action. Since the Peking regime, in point of military
forces available for world-wide action, was on about the same
level as Liberia, the fact that China remained a second-rate
power instead of becoming a plain victim suggests the degree
of her international prestige. The Peking government provided
a background, however shadowy, for the Chinese Foreign Office,
and the Foreign Office carefully nursed the fictions of China's
international status. Moreover, some domestic machinery
remained. Around the Peking government there clustered a
group of administrations which were so purely bureaucratic
and non-policy-making in character that they were tolerated
even by the military, or else were under the protection of international
agreements. The Maritime Customs in Shanghai
was staffed in its key positions with Westerners. This feature
arose out of conditions during the T'ai-p'ing rebellion; it was later
given international status by Chinese assurances that under
certain stipulations the customs were to retain their foreign
personnel. The autonomy of the customs became a striking
characteristic of the international legal and financial position of
China, since most of the Chinese debts were secured by a mortgage
on customs receipts.<sup><a href="#fn129" id="r129">11</a></sup> The Salt Revenue Administration
was similarly separated from the rest of the Chinese bureaucracy
by international agreement, since loans had been secured upon
this revenue. The surpluses from both services were paid for
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_160" title="pg 160"> </a>
the greater part to the central government at Peking and provided
a definite fiscal incentive for the maintenance of the Republic.
The Chinese Post Office was also manned in part by Westerners,
and it managed to preserve reasonably good postal service
throughout the country despite the governmental anarchy which
otherwise prevailed. These administrations were largely autonomous;
they made up the deficiencies of the Peking government
so far as it was within their power. Thus the regime could
boast of an excellent written constitution, a first-class Foreign
Office, several good revenue agencies, a good postal service, and
almost nothing else.</p>

<p>In the age of the <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> the Peking regime had no domestic
power to speak of; most of the time government was by courtesy
only.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Governments of Sun Yat-sen in Canton</a></em></p>

<p>In 1917, when the National Assembly was dissolved for the
second time by the intervention of the <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> Chang Hs&uuml;n, a
group of its members met first in Shanghai and then adjourned
to Canton. Assembling as an Extraordinary Parliament, it
elected Sun Yat-sen Generalissimo of the South. He was not
given the title of president because he did not wish to create
the appearance of national disunity. Sun was in the peculiar
position of being placed in military command at the sufferance
of regional military leaders. He even had to fight for support
in the rump parliament which had elected him.</p>

<p>In this first Cantonese government, Sun's military objectives
overshadowed all others. Attempts were made to promote a
frontal assault on the army plague, and various expeditions were
launched against the North. Sun Yat-sen had his experiences
in the years of revolt before 1911 to hearten him. The Republican
Revolution of 1911-1912 was not so much a carefully timed
universal conspiracy as it was the seizure of a few pivotal points
by small bands of revolutionists, backed by provincial support.
Sun did not think in terms of nationalism as yet, for he felt that
with the expulsion of the Manchus the Chinese had solved the
major problem of foreign oppression. His course of action in
the first Cantonese government was therefore that of a man fighting
on a constitutional and democratic issue while leaning on a
temporary military government. His new regime had acquired
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_161" title="pg 161"> </a>
at one time an enormous reach of territory by bringing under its
fold, through a process of negotiation and intrigue, the leading
military figures of Southern China.</p>

<p>Sun was, however, working too much outside his own party.
He had both the parliament and the Southern militarists to
contend with. The task of maintaining a revolutionary movement
with troops who were no more interested in it than the
troops opposing them, transcended even Sun's optimism and
courage. Despite demonstrations of his personal capacity and
bravery, he felt that his work lacked momentum. In May,
1918, after his office as generalissimo had been abolished and he
had been made one of a Supreme Committee of Seven, Sun left
for Shanghai.</p>

<p>In Shanghai Sun had time to ponder organizational strategy,
to conduct the world-wide operations of the Kuomintang
officially now <em>Chung-hua K&ecirc;-ming Tang</em>, or Chinese Revolutionary
Party, and to consider types of government and methods
of propaganda. He worked with Judge Paul Linebarger, his
sympathizer and supporter since 1906, on a biography similar
to the campaign biographies of American presidential candidates.<sup><a href="#fn130" id="r130">14</a></sup>
At this time he was still devoting himself to the
organization of the existing groups in Chinese society for revolutionary
purposes. He saw himself as the moral leader of the
revolution and simultaneously as the necessary advocate of
constitutionalism. He was anxious to implement the ideological
revolution but thought that the parliamentary democratic
techniques had been designed in the West to accomplish just
that end. While he was in Shanghai, the Canton regime carried
on a fragmentary existence. In November, 1920, he returned
to Canton after his military friends had cleared the way for him.
On this occasion the Canton government came forth as a fully
civilian regime. Sun was elected Extraordinary President of
the Republic of China by the Southern parliament in April,
1921. Using the city of Canton as his base, Sun continued the
long series of military expeditions he had led for years, trying to
whip the <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> at their own game without becoming one himself.
He personally went with forces into the field again. In
1922 treason on the part of his chief war-lord supporter drove
him out of Canton. Back in Shanghai, he established contact
with the representative of the Soviets, Adolf Joffe; both
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_162" title="pg 162"> </a>
men stipulated the terms of the alliance between the Kuomintang
and the Communists.<sup><a href="#fn131" id="r131">13</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1923 Sun laid new emphasis on one part of his program
hitherto neglected: the doctrine of the three stages of revolution.
The revolution had failed in fact because it had not provided
adequate measures for democratic training. The revolutionists
had assumed an organic political change, and militarists had
profited by their mistake in taking over the Republic and using
its forms to subvert what were the merest beginnings of democracy.
Henceforth, the revolutionary group would have to
emphasize a sequential process in democratic state construction:
(1) the acquisition of political power by the missionaries of the
revolution; (2) the teaching of the new ideology of democracy
and the training of the people in the techniques of self-government;
(3) the establishment of constitutional democracy.<sup><a href="#fn132" id="r132">12</a></sup>
When offered the opportunity of forming his third Canton
government, he took no chances and himself assumed the title
generalissimo and the command of the armies. In October,
1923, a plan was drawn up for the reorganization of the Kuomintang,
with the advice of Borodin. Next January the First
Congress of the Party opened. Sun Yat-sen, delighted with
the new instrument for promoting the ideological revolution,
allowed government problems to recede. The Party came to
the front, and with the Party organization were to be solved
the problems of a universe in revolution. During the fifteen
months of life which remained to Sun Yat-sen, his third government
at Canton was not to undergo any transformation. The
strictly political purposes of the revolution had become mere
adjuncts to the ideological and military features. The government
continued to possess the now familiar parliamentary-democratic
formulas which, misused and deformed as they were
throughout China, had come to be the embroidery of might.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Nationalist Government, Soviet in Form</a></em></p>

<p>The sorry picture of inadequacy in both the North and the
South was interrupted by the launching of the Nationalist
Revolution of 1926-1927. As a preparatory step to the acquisition
of revolutionary power, Sun Yat-sen's followers reorganized
the Canton government in June, 1925. This action followed
Sun's death on March 11, 1925, in Peking, where he had gone to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_163" title="pg 163"> </a>
take part in a reunification conference with the leading <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>
of the North. The conference had failed, but it is characteristic
that Sun, embittered though he was, lent his last hours to
formulating a compromise. The new Canton government took
the name of <em>The Nationalist Government of China</em>, thereby
disavowing succession from the ineffectual Republic which
preceded it. It remained in Canton until the end of 1926; on
January 1, 1927, it was transferred to Hankow, the greatest
inland city of China, located some six hundred miles up the
Yangtze River from Shanghai. Hankow is one of three sister
cities collectively termed the Wu-han cities; hence this phase
of the Nationalist Government is referred to as the Wu-han
regime. It came to an end in the fall of 1927, enjoyed a
momentary resurrection in Canton, and then passed into
history, being succeeded by another Nationalist Government at
Nanking.</p>

<p>In the last two years of his life, Sun had come to stress again
his principle of nationalism. After the birth of the 1912 Republic
he had for some years placed in the foreground democracy and
<em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em>, until he became aware that the problem of China's
internal reconstruction could not be solved without an adequate
adjustment of foreign relations. He saw that the <em>tuch&uuml;n</em> wars
were influenced by competing imperialisms, agreed upon resistance
to the Chinese revolution while expressing pious hopes for
Chinese unity. Accordingly, the Kuomintang began emphasizing
its nationalist character, and Sun's followers, previously
termed Republicans or merely revolutionaries, were
called Nationalists. With a program of anti-imperialism,
anti-<em>tuch&uuml;nism</em>, and national unification, the Party began
making great headway. The propaganda machinery which the
Russian advisers had devised was turned against the vested
interests. In addition, the rapid rise of the Nationalists must be
explained through their party organization and the creation
of agencies linked with the Party, such as youth groups, labor
unions, peasant unions, and women's associations. Thus,
instead of trying to superimpose a modern government upon
preexisting social forms, the Nationalists built their government
by molding the social groups necessary to its support.</p>

<p>The government was composed of a hierarchy of committees,
similar to the Soviet system in Russia. The topmost committees
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_164" title="pg 164"> </a>
of the government were subject to the control of the Central
Executive Committee of the Party. The Party secured its
authority through a policy of democratic centralism buttressed
by the election of a Party Congress from the various branches
of the party. Power thus followed a perfectly clear and traceable
line; it did not depend upon mock elections or upon indefinite
delegations of authority. The party members elected the
delegates to the Party Congress; the Party Congress chose a
Central Executive Committee; the Central Executive Committee
or its Standing Committee controlled the Political Council
(policy-making) and the Administrative Council (cabinet),
together with the Military Council. These three were the
supreme government agencies. The same party authorities
appointed and removed all members of all other councils in
provincial or municipal governments. There was not the
faintest show of popular participation in the government;
government had become the exclusive tool of the Party.
But by being admittedly a tool, the government possessed
definite power.</p>

<p>Party agencies opened wide the doors of mass participation,
not in the government but in the movement. The Nationalist
Revolution won with the assistance of the Communists in 1926-1927
rested on the extension of every conceivable agitational
device to every group of the population. The government
tied these devices together. Halfway on the road to victory
the differences between the Right and Left Kuomintang, and
between the Communists and the Kuomintang, became too
acute to allow for further operation. In April, 1927, Chiang
K'ai-shek, the Nationalist Generalissimo, established a Nationalist
Government at Nanking. The Nationalist Government,
soviet in form, remained in Hankow for a few more months,
transferred again to Canton, and then expired. Even so, the
councils of the Nationalist governments at Canton and Wu-han
had served their purpose well; they had effected the concentration
of power, instead of its division, in the course of a revolution
when concentration was at a premium. With the approaching
victory and peace, the council form of government began to
appear to the Chinese as no less alien than parliamentarism.
The Nanking government set out to reconstitute a government
both Chinese and modern.</p>

<h3><em>Chapter</em> VIII</h3>

<h2><a href="#contents">RECONSTRUCTION</a></h2>


<p>The National Government of China set up at Nanking in
April, 1927, was not definitively organized until late that year.
Chiang K'ai-shek had to resign from the government before
the Left Kuomintang group would accept the regime. In the
following year, with the return of Chiang and the adoption of a
new constitution (Organic Law of the National Government),
the Nanking government was more firmly established than any
previous government since the death of Y&uuml;an Shih-k'ai. A
high price had been paid for stability: Northern military leaders
had been allowed to join it, much as those of the South had
supported Sun Yat-sen ten years before. The break with the
Communists meant stopping a vast agrarian-proletarian revolution
midway in its course, at a cost of many lives. The Nationalists,
thrust into the role of governors, could not avoid turning
against many of those who had helped to put them in power
but wished to continue the revolution.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The National Government of China</a></em></p>

<p>Despite the difficulties which it faced, the National Government
had many assets. In the realm of ideology, it had the
advantage of possessing a state philosophy and a patron saint:
the <em>San Min Chu I</em><sup><a href="#fn133" id="r133">1</a></sup> and its author, Sun Yat-sen. In the military
sphere, it had at its disposal an army unequaled in China; in
the economic, the support of the Chinese bourgeoisie, together
with the friendly interest of the capitalist powers. In the
province of politics, it carried with it much of the personnel
formerly serving the Nationalist Government, soviet in form,
to which it claimed succession. Its officials were accustomed
to devote themselves seriously to government, so that from the
very beginning the Nanking government was inclined to enforce
its laws as well as promulgate them&mdash;thereby breaking with the
usage of the shadow Republic at Peking. Finally, the new
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" title="pg 168"> </a>
government secured full international recognition with the flight
of Chang Tso-lin from Peking and the disappearance of the rival
regime in the North (1928).</p>

<p>Sun's state philosophy fulfilled a cardinal function. Even in
its most troubled phases, when military factors came closest to
the surface of government, the new government did not lapse
into fiction. There was a programmatic index against which
Nanking's accomplishments could be tested, and a definite long-range
plan to follow. The program enabled the National
Government to utilize the forms of revolution for the purpose of
stabilizing government&mdash;far less dangerous than the practice
of their Northern predecessors, to use government in order to
further disunited military despotism. The officers of the
Kuomintang exhibited a meticulous respect for the dead Leader
of their Party. Sun Yat-sen, known by his honorific pseudonym
<em>Chung Shan</em>, was buried in one of the most magnificent tombs
of modern times. In carrying out Sun's legacy, the Kuomintang
was pledged to the principles of intraparty democratic centralism
and party dictatorship over the rest of the nation. The formal
party organization was not seriously effected by the change from
a soviet form of government.</p>

<p>Government under the Kuomintang, despite the breakdown
of morale which followed the disintegration of the Great Revolution
(1927), was radically unlike that of the Peking regimes.
In 1927, when Chiang K'ai-shek turned against the peasant
unions and officialized the labor unions, a tendency toward outright
military dictatorship became apparent. The developments
of the following ten years did not at any time suggest that
military power had meekly yielded to governmental power, but
they did indicate that government was taking an increasing
part in the control of society. The close interrelation of ideology
and government, dating from the period of the Nationalist-Communist
alliance, was to endure after the revolution had
been transformed into a reconstructive process and rebellion had
been superseded by administration. However much Sun and his
teachings failed to create a new political Islam, they weathered
criticism sufficiently well to provide a scheme of policy, political
values, and broad objectives.</p>

<p>The influence of Sun Yat-sen was harmed, rather than reinforced,
by the hysterical ritualists who seem to be the parasites
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_169" title="pg 169"> </a>
of all one-party governments. The memory of the Leader and
his teachings settled into the stabilizing roles of founding father
and general dogma. Only a few veterans of the movement are
still inspired by the fire of his words and the vigor of his personality.
To the vast bulk of Chinese public opinion Sun Yat-sen
is the human embodiment of virtuous, brave, and intelligent
conduct, whose theories are acceptable in their general form
and whose programs have proved pragmatically usable. The
<em>San Min Chu I</em> failed to cause widespread political ecstasy;
it succeeded in bringing direction and sanity, after a limited
fashion. To spread allegiance the government fostered a
Sun Yat-sen memorial ritual; every Monday morning, in every
government office, college, school, police station, and other public
building, there was held a service consisting of the reading of Sun
Yat-sen's political testament and passages from his speeches
clarifying his doctrines. The services seemed for a while to
resemble a state religion; but the moderateness and formalism
of Chinese life was inimical to the fervor necessary for political
religion. The Kuomintang and its government came to see
these limitations; although the services have remained, they are
now severely secular in spirit.</p>

<p>The most dynamic part of the <em>San Min Chu I</em>, the doctrine
of nationalism, had contributed to placing the Kuomintang in
power. The new government was accordingly nationalist and
centralistic; it opposed any type of regionalism&mdash;political,
administrative, economic, or military. The Northern generals
who sided with the government at the time of its formation were
brought within the operation of the national military laws.
When they revolted&mdash;quite properly, according to their <em>tuch&uuml;n</em>
standards&mdash;against reduction of their forces in the Disbandment
War of 1930-1931, they were defeated. With the Southern and
the Western military leaders Chiang was not as successful, until
Japanese and Communist pressure brought first the one and
then the other group into his fold. After actual autonomy
for a number of years, the province of Kuangtung (Canton)
submitted in 1936 to the authority of the National Government,
thereby bringing to an end the generation-old division of North
and South. Nationalism and centralism affected not only the
armies but also the entire administration, whose service functions
and police powers developed amazingly. Although the Nanking
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" title="pg 170"> </a>
government had originally faced broad popular suspicion,
it began to win genuine respect because of its accomplishments.</p>

<p>Was the Nanking government a dictatorship? Its record
does not justify the assumption that it was merely to camouflage
a military dictatorship commandeered by Chiang K'ai-shek.
Moreover, the policy-making power was not by any means a
prerogative of Chiang K'ai-shek. Chiang was nearly sovereign
in technical military matters and possessed more political
influence than did any other single individual. Yet the power
of policy making rested with a small group of men not over a
hundred in number. Some of the gentlest, sincerest, and
quietest of these leaders had once been <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> in their own
right; some of the most military and forthright had never handled
anything more lethal than a cash register. The leaders tended
to work within the party and government structure, so that the
political organization, while not of great simplicity or clarity,
accurately portrayed the distribution of power. No one can
gauge the degree of interdependence between the leaders of a
government system in its formative period, and between the
offices which these leaders occupy. The Sian episode indicated
that the Nanking government could continue without Chiang
and that Chiang's incarceration was not the signal for immediate
anarchy. But Chiang was not actually dead, nor was the government
deprived of the support which his prestige had generated.
From 1927 to 1937 the Nanking government remained under
approximately the same leading officials.</p>

<p>The last test for the sources of Nanking's power may be found
in considering the relation between the men in command and the
authority which placed them there. The supreme organ of
the party was the Party Congress. This body did determine the
course of government policy frequently, and on such occasions
clarified issues through action. The Congress elected the Central
Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee
of the Kuomintang. The entire membership of the Congress
would vote in the elections, any of the members being eligible.
Since the Congress was composed of representatives from
the various regional and functional divisions of the party,
intraparty democracy was insured in theory and&mdash;though to a
lesser extent&mdash;in practice. The two top committees elected
smaller Standing Committees; the Central Executive Committee
in addition elected the Central Political Council, which
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_171" title="pg 171"> </a>
was the highest organ of government in China and the agency
through which the party controlled the government. The
Central Political Council did not seek to keep track of the detail
of government; it outlined governmental policy, appointed major
officials, and directed rather than supervised administration.
It was a policy-making body in the strictest sense, and its action
took effect upon the Council of State, which coordinated the
government establishments.<sup><a href="#fn134" id="r134">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Had there been a schism between the Nanking government
and the Kuomintang, it might have been possible to trace a
political issue as it was fought out&mdash;all the way from the party
membership up through the Party Congress and the Central
Executive Committee, from party to government by action
of the Central Political Council, and down through the Council of
State and the subordinated government organs to the administrative
network operating upon the broad masses of the populace.
In fact, however, no issue saw the light, since the same group that
dominated the party controlled the government. The relation
between the leaders and the Party Congresses can perhaps best
be compared with that between the leading personalities of a
Republican or Democratic convention in the United States and
the convention delegates. Convention action rarely transfers
power or upsets leadership, nor do constructive plans or formulated
policies emerge from convention sessions; and yet the conventions
cannot be regarded merely as tools in the hands of the
party leadership. A similar situation existed in China. Even
when Chiang and the other leaders seemed to hold the bag,
the meetings of the Party Congress did not lack importance,
and the issues before the Congress were not considered predetermined.
This was no personal regime in the Napoleonic
sense. Party dictatorship expressed itself in defined forms,
as a part of Sun Yat-sen's state philosophy. Benevolent
oligarchy of patriotic modernists, acting with party sanction
obtained through intraparty democratic processes, was not
foreign to Sun's mind. The Nanking government further
differed from fascist governments, and resembled the Russian,
in that it was democratic in intent; its dictatorial character
was avowedly temporary. Throughout the period during which
the Kuomintang ruled from Nanking, democracy was regarded
as a definite goal of governmental policy. The Japanese invasions
culminating in open war made impossible the immediate
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_172" title="pg 172"> </a>
abrogation of Kuomintang party dictatorship. Yet when war
broke out in 1937, the National Government was on the verge
of reconstituting itself as a democracy; but now the regime itself
became itinerant, moving into the hinterland.</p>

<p>The Nanking government was organized under Kuomintang
rule in a form unique among modern states. Its three most
distinctive features were: (1) the concentration of power in the
supreme agencies; (2) a fivefold division of power and function
through the <em>y&uuml;ans</em>; and (3) the absence of parliamentary chambers.<sup><a href="#fn135" id="r135">3</a></sup>
While the Organic Law was in effect as a constitution
(1928-1931), the government was headed by a president wielding
considerable power and a Council of State which served as the
chief control agency. In 1931 a National People's Convention
made up of representatives of the Kuomintang and of occupational
groups adopted a Provisional Constitution.<sup><a href="#fn136" id="r136">4</a></sup> Under this
constitution the power of the president was sharply reduced,
making him practically a titular officer. The Council of State
became a more formalized agency, and the greater weight of
government routine was placed in the Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em>. Under
the draft constitution proposed for the period after the end of
party dictatorship a presidential system was to have been
inaugurated.</p>

<p>The years 1931-1937 were characterized by the use of the
Council of State as the supreme agency of formal government.
The president of the National Government was little more than
the chairman of the Council. The Council received instructions
from the Central Political Council, and transmitted them to
the five regular departments of government in the form of
policies. Great as its powers may seem to be, the Council of
State was largely an intermediary agency, although the personal
influence of its members was extensive. The Council, with its
administrative adjuncts, was of value in that it provided an
institutional center for the government and gave governmental
form to the commands of the party. There was no judicial
check on the executive or the legislative branches.</p>

<p>The fivefold division of powers (adopted as the <em>y&uuml;an</em> system)
is one of the most original points in Sun Yat-sen's political
scheme. <em>Y&uuml;an</em> is an almost untranslatable Chinese term
signifying a "public body" and used in modern China to designate
the five great coordinate departments of government.</p>

<p>The Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em> was headed, as were all the others, by a
<em>y&uuml;an</em> president (<em>y&uuml;an-chang</em>), assisted by a vice-president, a
secretary-general, and a director of political affairs. The y&uuml;an
included all the major executive ministries, and the formal
meeting of the Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em> was a meeting of the <em>Y&uuml;an</em>
officers, the heads of the ministries, and other directing officials.
Such meetings took place once a week and corresponded to
cabinet meetings in Western countries. The executive work
of the entire government was performed by the Executive
<em>Y&uuml;an</em> and&mdash;through characteristic Chinese devices&mdash;the <em>Y&uuml;an</em>
Secretariat, divided into bureaus and committees, came to
occupy a position of high strategic importance in Chinese government.
All executive measures were funneled through the
Secretariat, which cast them into proper form and determined
whether or not they should be put on the <em>y&uuml;an</em> agenda. It thus
occupied a position not unlike that of the Grand Chancery and
Grand Secretariat of the T'ang dynasty or of the Office of
Transmissions under the Manchus. The Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em>
combined within itself nine ministries: Interior (having charge of
provincial and local government), Foreign Affairs, Military
Affairs, Navy, Finance, Industries, Education, Communications,
and Railways. Included were also a number of special commissions
and agencies.</p>

<p>The Legislative <em>Y&uuml;an</em> consisted of a president, a vice-president,
and eighty-six members, with an extensive administrative
staff attached to it. The <em>y&uuml;an</em> was divided, as are parliaments,
into committees, but it was not a representative body, nor able
to enact laws independently of the other divisions of government.
Its president's powers were so wide as to make the
cameral organization of the <em>y&uuml;an</em> more apparent than real and
to reduce the <em>y&uuml;an</em> to a legislative drafting and research agency.
The Judicial <em>Y&uuml;an</em> was made up of four establishments: Supreme
Court, Administrative Court, Commission for the Disciplinary
Punishment of Public Functionaries (dealing with the government
personnel below political rank), and the Ministry of
Justice. The Examination <em>Y&uuml;an</em>, composed of two divisions
(Examination Commission and Ministry of Personnel) gave
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_175" title="pg 175"> </a>
expression to the Chinese tradition of separate examining
agencies. Its function was to provide a merit system applicable
to the whole government staff, except those relatively few positions
which were political in nature. Because of the difficulty
of developing elaborate machinery under unusual circumstances,
the Examination <em>Y&uuml;an</em> did not establish for itself a high standard
of accomplishment. Finally, the Control <em>Y&uuml;an</em> served as a
chamber of censors entitled to bring suit against dishonest or
treacherous officials, and maintained a central Ministry of Audit.
In the last few years of the Nanking regime it brought over two
hundred and fifty cases to bar each year.</p>

<p>An informative picture of the practical workings of one of the
key parts of the National Government, the Secretariat of the
Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em>, is given by Tsiang Ting-fu, the Chinese ambassador
to the Soviet Union and formerly one of the ranking
officials of that <em>Y&uuml;an</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of General Affairs keeps the internal machinery of the
Secretariat going. It receives the dispatches and distributes them
among the sections. It manages the funds and looks after supplies.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Confidential Affairs handles confidential telegrams
and keeps the secret codes.</p>

<p>The Secretaries in the Drafting Bureau draft documents that
require high literary finish, usually formal documents.</p>

<p>The Reception Bureau takes care of callers and visitors and sees
to it that dignitaries who come to the Executive Y&uuml;an for business
or courtesy calls are accorded a due reception.</p>

<p>The Meetings Bureau arranges for all meetings held in, or under
the auspices of, the Executive Y&uuml;an.</p>

<p>The Compilation and Translation Bureau watches over the
periodical press, both Chinese and foreign.</p>

<p>The real political work is done in the Sections. Let us take up
first political correspondence. A minister, governor, or mayor sends
a dispatch to the Executive Y&uuml;an, asking for instructions in regard
to, let us say, a problem in raising funds. It goes to Section 5.
The head clerk and his assistants look up regulations, precedents,
and other relevant facts and write a memorandum. The dispatch
with the memorandum goes to the secretary or councillor in charge
of the Section, who writes a minute suggesting a solution or approving
a solution suggested by the head clerk. Then the dispatch, memorandum,
and minute go to the Director of Political Affairs, who,
taking into consideration political factors, renders a tentative decision
for final approval by the Secretary-General. The clerical staff
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_176" title="pg 176"> </a>
sticks to law, tradition, and precedent. Adjustments are usually
made only by the ranks above. As the majority of problems are
so-called routine problems, in connection with which the opinion of
the clerical staff is usually sound, the ranks above usually accept the
proposed solution. What is important and bothersome is the
minority of unusual problems, for the treatment of which procedures
are varied.</p>

<p>The sender of a dispatch dealing with an unusual problem may call,
or send a representative to call, on the Secretary-General or the
Director of Political Affairs before or simultaneously with the sending
of the dispatch, giving a personal detailed explanation of the matter
and sounding the opinion of the Executive Y&uuml;an as represented by
the Secretary-General and the Director of Political Affairs. An
agreed solution may be arrived at during the interview. In that
case the correspondence will be only formal. But the parties involved
may disagree, in which case the Secretary-General will
courteously say that the matter must be referred to the President or
to the Y&uuml;an meeting, and the Director has an additional solution
of the problem by resorting to consultation with the Secretary-General.
In some cases the Secretary-General and the Director
will decide the matter during the interview whether the caller likes
it or not.</p>

<p>Some unusual matters touch several jurisdictions, <em>i.e.</em>, two or three
ministries; or a number of provinces or cities; or both. The Executive
Y&uuml;an then calls a meeting of representatives of the jurisdictions
affected and the matter is threshed out there. The conclusions of
such meetings may be referred to the President or to the Y&uuml;an
meetings.</p>

<p>In dealing with unusual problems of primary importance the
Secretary-General usually consults the President, and the Director of
Political Affairs consults the Secretary-General in most cases and the
President in some cases where the work is specifically assigned to the
Director by the President.</p>

<p>The average of dispatches (including telegrams) received and sent
out daily by the Executive Y&uuml;an is about three hundred, of which
number only two or three need to be referred to the President or the
Y&uuml;an meeting, the rest being handled by the Secretariat without
such reference.</p>

<p>The Secretariat on its part, by the order of the President as Chairman
of the Y&uuml;an meeting, or on the initiative of the Secretary-General
or at the suggestion of the Director of Political Affairs, sends dispatches
to the ministries, commissions, provinces and municipalities,
in the form of decrees, ordinances, instructions, inquiries and requests.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_177" title="pg 177"> </a></p>

<p>The energies of the clerical staff are devoted entirely to the incoming
and outgoing correspondence. About half of the time of the
secretaries and councillors is devoted to correspondence and half
to conferences. The sub-committees created by the Y&uuml;an meeting
are numerous and are almost always convoked by the Secretariat.
In a few cases the Secretary-General and the Director of Political
Affairs, usually accompanied by a secretary or councillor, attend;
in most cases, however a secretary or a councillor is designated as the
Y&uuml;an's representative. The conclusions of such sub-committees are
always reported back to the Y&uuml;an meeting.<sup><a href="#fn137" id="r137">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strange as the <em>y&uuml;an</em> system may appear, it seems to have been
the most effectual form of government that the Chinese have
devised in the Republican era. In times of military or revolutionary
crisis, however, this elaborate scheme of bureaucratic
departmentalization would prove too cumbersome for rapid
readjustment and action; during the Japanese invasions, great
reliance was placed on the creation of emergency commissions.
In addition to the <em>y&uuml;ans</em> there were a number of agencies which
did not fit into the five-power scheme. Great independent
establishments were attached directly to the Council of State.
An Academia Sinica took the place of the Han Lin of imperial
times as a national center for scholarship. A National Economic
Council and a National Reconstruction Commission performed
specialized functions effectively, with assistance from experts
provided by the League of Nations. In fact, there was a scattering
of foreign advisers throughout the government. Of these
the highest in rank were placed at the disposal of the Council of
State, some rendering actual technical service, others active in
unofficial representation abroad, propaganda, lobbying in foreign
capitals, or similar tasks. Other advisers were attached to the
<em>y&uuml;ans</em> and to the ministries.</p>

<p>Provincial government under the Nanking regime was subordinated
to the Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em> through the Ministry of the
Interior. The provinces each possessed a commission form of
government, with the commission chairman serving as titular
head of the province. The actual operation of the provincial
governments exhibited a great deal of variation, depending on
the character of the area, the extent of its political development,
and the tangible influence enjoyed by the National Government.
The provincial commission combined the policy-making, policy-executing,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_178" title="pg 178"> </a>
and quasi-judicial functions, operating largely on the
basis of instructions from Nanking and transmitting reports
through the Secretariat of the Executive <em>Y&uuml;an</em> at the other end.
Attached to each commission were a secretariat and four or more
departments&mdash;mainly civil affairs, finance, reconstruction, and
education. The department heads were members of the commission&mdash;a
type of government not unlike that of American
cities under the Galveston plan. The theory of Sun Yat-sen
provided, however, that the province should decrease in importance
with the growth of modern government in China, so that
the dangerous regionalism in the country would eventually be
denied overt political expression. He saw the future significance
of the provincial governments only in their role as intermediaries
for <em>hsien</em>-national relationships. Under the National Government
while at Nanking, the tendency was to centralize control
and to emphasize national guidance in those provinces squarely
under Nationalist rule. In other provinces the provincial governments
tended to follow local conditions and mirror the national
standards as a matter of decorum only. The provincial governments
were far less important in the life of the provinces than
was the National Government for the nation. They had the
national civilian and military authorities to cope with, in addition
to the impositions of their own local military. Their
sources of revenue were not ample, and their authority not well
established. In some provinces the commission form was
adopted only as a matter of legal compliance, leaving to local
leaders the actual conduct of affairs. In fact, reform centered on
the <em>hsien</em> rather than the province, partly because the province
was a potential rival to the nation, and partly because the <em>hsien</em>
was a more organic unit in Chinese society.</p>

<p>Between the provincial authorities and those of the <em>hsien</em> there
stood Special Commissioners of Administrative Inspection, whose
function was to relate the two administrative units and to work
for the modernization of <em>hsien</em> organization. The <em>hsien</em> served,
and still serves, not only a rural area but also the central municipality
in which the <em>hsien</em> magistrate has his headquarters. The
<em>yam&ecirc;n</em> (official building) occupies the center of the town, mostly
a one-story edifice built around a courtyard; some <em>yam&ecirc;ns</em> still
display the two flagpoles and the two stone lions that were required
by the custom of the Empire. Usually the <em>yam&ecirc;n</em> contains:</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_179" title="pg 179"> </a></p>

<p>"(<em>a</em>) the rooms occupied by the tax collectors and the administrative
and judicial police; (<em>b</em>) the court and the assembly room;
(<em>c</em>) the offices of the various bureaus; (<em>d</em>) the residence for magistrates
and the dormitory for officers."<sup><a href="#fn138" id="r138">6</a></sup> The conduct of <em>hsien</em>
government is influenced by three main groups&mdash;the illiterate
masses, the conservative gentry, and the younger progressives.
In those <em>hsien</em> units where no reformist or revolutionary pressure
is felt, the magistrate and the tax collector do little more than collect
funds, and the administration is marked by the laxity which
characterized old Chinese government in its inadequate form.
The gentry, the scholar-administrators, and the tax collectors
represent a single social group and manage to rule in their own
economic interest. In other <em>hsien</em> units the influence of modern
government is noticeable; the magistrate is in most cases a man
determined to put into effect the standards of twentieth-century
administration. The prestige and power of young men with
modern educations have so increased that they are able to
obtain a considerable number of magistracies, and if they are
willing they may introduce a respectable measure of good
government and reform.</p>

<p>The magistrate selects his secretary and four bureau heads,
subject to the approval of the provincial authorities. The
secretary performs the work usually expected of permanent
officials, carrying on much of the routine so as to leave the
magistrate free for political and quasi-judicial functions. The
secretary is virtually a vice-magistrate and, if successful, keeps
the governmental machinery of the <em>hsien</em> in smooth operation.
When the magistrate is absent, he acts as the substitute. The
four bureaus of the <em>hsien</em> correspond to the four chief administrative
divisions of the province&mdash;civil affairs, finance, reconstruction,
and education. An opium suppression bureau is
often added, carrying on the anti-narcotic campaign. The civil
affairs bureau has charge of the census, and supervises local
areas within the district. Such matters as police, militia, sanitary
administration, public buildings, classical shrines, and
parks are frequently under its jurisdiction. The subordinate
units of administration are provisional, but the <em>pao-chia</em> system
has been restored at the lowest level. This is a device for the
mutual guarantee, protection, and responsibility of citizens,
in which ten families make a <em>pao</em> and ten <em>pao</em> make a <em>chia</em>. The
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_180" title="pg 180"> </a>
tax bureau is one of the weakest links in Chinese local government,
as in this office corruption is rife, and severe oppression of
the farmers most frequent. In unreformed <em>hsien</em> units, the tax
bureau is likely to be the political plum of members of the local
gentry, who use it to extend their tenant farms, promote usury,
and defraud the government. The provincial governments have
begun to send out accountants and to install regular bookkeeping
systems&mdash;an undertaking which if completed would be
one of the major reforms of local administration.</p>

<p>In the smaller <em>hsien</em> units the magistrate is assisted for judicial
purposes by a judge; in the larger, separate courts are provided.
Up to the outbreak of hostilities in 1937 the national and provincial
governments were making great strides in reorganizing
judicial administration and in the professionalization of police
work. The judges are appointees of the provincial courts, a
factor which may make for greater professional capacity and
independence. The general importance of the <em>hsien</em> is illustrated
by the fact that in Manchoukuo the Japanese have been forced
to revive this system. They have, however, implemented it
with a Japanese officer known as the <em>Kanjikan</em>, who is supposed
to advise his Chinese colleague. The experiment is of great
interest, as it provides the acid test for the Japanese attempt
actually to administer a Chinese area. Without firm <em>hsien</em>
governments beneath them, the Japanese puppet regimes are
foredoomed to failure.<sup><a href="#fn139" id="r139">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Until the beginning of the undeclared war, the departmentalization
and modernization of the <em>hsien</em> had proceeded most extensively
in certain model districts selected for the purpose of
political and administrative experimentation. Some of these
had reached a level of efficiency which augured well for the future
of Chinese government. With the coming of war, however,
administrative interests had to yield in many cases to political
or military ones, but in one significant respect <em>hsien</em> government
was constructively affected. The evocation of popular interest
in and cooperation with the government caused a great acceleration
of progress toward local democracy, and focused attention
on reaction and corruption in the inland regions. War propaganda
among the masses of the people amounted to a call for
public-spirited action; such action is bound to take the form of
direct military enlistment or of collaboration in local patriotic
and defense schemes.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_181" title="pg 181"> </a></p>

<p>Municipal government in old China was carried on largely by
the officials of the imperial or provincial bureaucracy. Cities
and towns were graded and even named according to the rank
of the office for which they served as headquarters. The
imperial administration thus extended to municipal affairs; each
municipal government included a designated rural area surrounding
the city. With the growth of modern government in China,
plans were considered for a definite and systematic development
of municipal administration. The foreign-controlled cities of
the coast provided models of Western administration, and the
Chinese were not slow to copy. A few years ago the cities of
China were divided for administrative purposes into three
categories: those administered directly by the national government;
those placed directly under the provincial governments;
and those for which no special category was provided, leaving
them under the established bureaucratic hierarchy. In 1936
there were five cities of the first class (Nanking, Peiping, Shanghai,
Tientsin, and Tsingtao) and eighteen of the second class,
including the very important cities of Hankow and Canton. The
municipal administration is headed by the mayor and the
council. The mayor is appointed by the authority under whose
jurisdiction the city is placed. The council is composed of two
appointed councillors and the chiefs of the municipal bureaus&mdash;four
or more. The four required bureaus are civil affairs, finance,
public works, and education. Intracity organization was
accomplished through the use of <em>ch'u</em>, or wards, subdivided into
family groups of defined size. With the development of democracy
it was intended for each of these to take part in the promotion
of self-government; at each level representatives should
be chosen by free suffrage. The family foundation has remained
a significant feature even of municipal administration.</p>

<p>The chief political question before the National Government
at the outbreak of hostilities in the summer of 1937 was the
adoption of a permanent democratic constitution. This was to be
accomplished in much the same way that the Provisional Constitution
had been adopted in 1931&mdash;by means of a specially elected
People's Congress. In the meantime, a draft constitution had
reached a nearly final form. The outstanding features of the
draft included the strengthening of the presidency, the abolition
of the Kuomintang party dictatorship, the extension of a widely
defined suffrage to operate on an unprecedented scale, and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_182" title="pg 182"> </a>
provision for periodically assembling People's Congresses to
take, by and large, the position of the Kuomintang by exercising
the four powers of the people: initiative, referendum, election, and
recall. The elective offices would be reduced to a few. The
installation and removal of the major government officers was
a function to be divided between the People's Congress and the
president, who was himself to be elected and recalled by the
Congress.</p>

<p>The Japanese invasion led to the scattering and the partial
suspension of government. Military needs began to rule the hour.
The Kuomintang Party Congress held in the spring of 1938
elevated Chiang K'ai-shek to the newly-created position of
<em>Tsung-tsai</em>&mdash;a term meaning Party Leader, which had been the
office held by Sun Yat-sen under the more august synonym
<em>Tsung-li</em>. Not only was this a partial recognition of the leadership
principle<sup><a href="#fn140" id="r140">8</a></sup> in a democracy at war and a testimonial to Chiang
as the supreme military leader of the Republic, but it was also a
substantial grant of power. Four new powers were given
Chiang as Party Leader: (1) the position of Chairman of the
National Kuomintang Congress; (2) the chairmanship of the
Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang; (3) the power
to ask (impliedly, to demand) that the National Kuomintang
Congress reconsider its resolutions, which amounted to the grant
of a courteous but effective conditional veto; and (4) final
authority on Central Executive Committee resolutions, by means
of a parallel veto.<sup><a href="#fn141" id="r141">9</a></sup> This apparent trend toward emergency one-man
control was, however, offset by the convening on July 6,
1938, of the People's Political Council, an advisory all-Party
representative body, designed to substitute temporarily for the
again-postponed National Congress. Its appearance was the
widest break in the formal front of one-party Kuomintang rule to
occur in a decade, and was heralded as a signal for the practical
democratization of the government.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Chinese Soviet Republic</a></em></p>

<p>After the suppression of the Marxists by Chiang K'ai-shek
and the liquidation of the Nationalist government at Wu-han,
the Chinese Communist movement took to underground agitation.
It demonstrated its power, however, by proclaiming
the Canton Commune on December 11, 1927. The Commune
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_183" title="pg 183"> </a>
ended in bloody suppression. At the same time, in the far
interior, the first Chinese Soviet had been established; from it,
in Tsalin on the Hunan-Kiangsi border, was to develop the
Chinese Soviet Republic.</p>

<p>On the fourth anniversary of the Canton Commune the Chinese
Soviet Republic came into official being. A constitution was
adopted, and soon in the Communist districts soviets began to
spread during a period of relative peace. Nevertheless, the
Soviet organization was always under considerable pressure
because of the war waged upon it by Chiang. Although labor
and agrarian legislation was adopted, the regime had to operate
under conditions of extreme military activity, counterrevolution,
and terror. Despite all these handicaps, the Communists kept
their government intact; they were able to move it thousands
of miles across China in the historic Long March from South
Central to Northwest China, which began October 16, 1934, and
ended October 20, 1935.</p>

<p>Under its constitution, the Chinese Soviet Republic is declared
to be "the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants."<sup><a href="#fn142" id="r142">10</a></sup>
The suffrage was set at the age of sixteen. The government was
formed in a manner similar to that employed in the U. S. S. R.
before the adoption of the new Soviet Constitution: local soviets
elect district or city soviets, which in turn elect provincial
soviets, which elect a National Congress of Soviets. In practice,
the pattern could not be followed closely, since elections were
difficult to hold and territorial division not always certain. The
Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets was
the chief political authority of the Communist regime; it had
the familiar executive organization of the Soviet system: a
Presidium of the Central Executive Committee and under it
the People's Council, the equivalent of a cabinet. The strength
of the Chinese Communists lay in their Party and adjunct
organizations, in their land policy, and in their Red Army.</p>

<p>The central government of the Chinese Soviet Republic was
no mere torso. It included the following agencies immediately
subordinate to the People's Council: the Supreme Court, the
Ministry of Inspection, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Land, the Ministry of Labor, the Revolutionary Military Commissariat,
the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Political Safety
Bureau, the Ministry of Communications, the People's Economic
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_184" title="pg 184"> </a>
Commissariat, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Food, the
Ministry of Education, and&mdash;strangely&mdash;the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.</p>

<p>As a result of the kidnaping at Sian at the end of 1936, the
Nationalists and the Communists drifted toward a <em>rapprochement</em>.
The next February the Central Executive Committee of
the Kuomintang accepted the Communist offer of United Front
collaboration, although disguising the acceptance by formal conditions
for a Communist surrender. In September the Chinese
Soviet Republic was ready to assume the name of <em>Special Administrative
District of the Chinese Republic</em>. This left their governmental
and administrative organization unaffected; nor did it
mean the dissolution of the Red Army, now also under a new
name, that of the Eighth Route Army. With the commencement
of the Japanese advance, Communist leaders began taking
part in the work of the National Government, first at Nanking
and then inland.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">Other Governments in China</a></em></p>

<p>As the National Government at Nanking rose to a dominant
position in Chinese affairs, regional regimes outside its fold found
it less easy to fit themselves into the framework of the new
Chinese state. The Disbandment War of 1930-1931 had
witnessed the defeat of the two most redoubtable <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>
remaining in the North. On the other hand, it became increasingly
evident that acceptance of the Nanking hegemony in name
led to the infiltration of Nanking rule in fact.</p>

<p>Nothing but a register of encyclopedic proportions could list
and describe the various political institutions which arose calling
themselves <em>governments</em> in the troubled quarter-century of the
Chinese Republican era. Some have bordered on the pathological:
Islamistan, for instance, which was the work of an
Englishman who proclaimed himself emperor of a new Moslem
Empire in Central Asia. The provincial authorities of Chinese
Turkestan (Sinkiang) drove him out by using airplanes borrowed
from the Soviet Union. In Foochow, in 1932-1933, there arose
a movement headed by exiled Left Kuomintang leaders and other
ultra-patriots eager for immediate war with Japan. This government
was the first in years which did not pay lip service to the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_185" title="pg 185"> </a>
<em>San Min Chu I</em>, nor claimed legitimate descent from the movement
of Sun Yat-sen and his revolutionaries&mdash;a surprising
circumstance. Its very flexible constitution would have permitted
collaboration with the Chinese Soviets&mdash;had the Red
leaders not decided against it. The other main point in which
it varied from the pattern set by the Nanking government
was its profession of federalism. Known as the Federal Revolutionary
Government of China, it lasted a few months only to be
destroyed by Chiang, who had no scruples against using the
weight of his modern armies, including planes and motorized
troops. These vegetations of government can only interest
the political botanist. Far more troublesome have been the
opposition governments mentored or sponsored by outside forces.
Tibet and Sinkiang (Chinese Turkestan) provided a fertile field
of anti-Nanking agitation. Two "states" in China proper&mdash;
Manchoukuo and an equally Japanese-controlled Peking Republic
(1937)&mdash;find their counterparts in three others located in
Chinese dependencies: the Communist republics of Outer
Mongolia and Tannu-Tuva, and the ambiguous "state" in
Eastern Inner Mongolia (sometimes called <em>M&ecirc;ngkokuo</em>).</p>

<p>These Communist republics are under stable government, and,
judged from reports which reach the outside, seem efficiently
administered. They lie in the former Imperial Russian sphere
of influence, south of the Sino-Russian border; except for the
complications which would have arisen internationally, they
might just as well have been in the Soviet Union as outside.
Both governments maintain legations in Moscow. It might
be mentioned that when the Russian Red Army invaded Manchuria
in 1929 during the conflict over the Chinese Eastern
Railway, a Barga Mongol Soviet was temporarily established.
The Communist "states" cannot be compared with the Chinese
Soviet Republic, which depended on no outside military support
and resulted from a great ideological drive. They serve as
advance posts of the Soviet Union&mdash;precedent for the creation of
puppet states within China. Years later the Japanese manufactured
a "state" in Eastern Inner Mongolia, with the cooperation
of anti-Chinese Mongol princes, which Japan has publicized
very little. Known in the world press as <em>M&ecirc;ngkokuo</em>, it provides
a Japanese buffer state to meet the Russian buffer of Outer
Mongolia. On October 29, 1937, it reached its latest phase
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" title="pg 186"> </a>
with the proclamation of the Autonomous Government of
Inner Mongolia.</p>

<p>The Great Empire of Manchou, to use its present official name,
arose as Manchoukuo. The word itself was a concession to world
opinion, as Manchuria is known to the Chinese simply as the
Three Eastern Provinces (Tung San Sh&ecirc;ng); its population is
overwhelmingly Chinese. With the development of Chinese
national unity, the Japanese position in this area was threatened.
They invaded Manchuria in September, 1931; the following
year they proclaimed the independence of Manchoukuo, inviting
the young man who as a child had been the last Manchu emperor
of China to serve as the head of the state. In 1934 he was
installed as Emperor Kang T&ecirc;h of the Great Empire of Manchou.
The Japanese have done a great deal toward bettering their own
economic position in Manchuria, but the effect of their policies on
the Chinese population is of doubtful merit. Equal motives
underlay the rebirth of Peking, where on December 14, 1937, the
Provisional Government of the Republic of China was proclaimed.<sup><a href="#fn143" id="r143">11</a></sup>
The old Peking-Republican flag was flown. The
heads of the new regime were aged men who already twenty
years ago had cooperated with the Japanese. Others served
under duress and performed their mock routine in the cold agony
of treason. The new administration is honeycombed with Japanese
"advisers" and under the domination of the Japanese army.</p>

<p>To round out their collection of puppet governments, the
Japanese established in the spring of 1938 a Reformed Government
of the Republic of China in Nanking, and even went so
far as to adopt&mdash;provisionally, at least&mdash;the constitutional form
of the National Government, which had moved upriver. This
regime was admittedly even more ephemeral than the others,
and the Japanese announced their intention of consolidating it
with the set-up they had organized in Peiping. For the time, it
was to be subordinate for purposes of theory to the Northern
regime, but the future of the whole Japanese adventure was in
doubt, and that of their half-conceived instrumentalities even
more dubious.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Growth of Government in China</a></em></p>

<p>In the decade following 1927, Chinese government became
more significant than it had been since the days of the founding
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_187" title="pg 187"> </a>
emperors of the Ch'in and the Han. Power was based on a
correlation of government with ideological and military forces.
The Nationalist Party was the first to effectuate this correlation,
in part as a result of lessons learned from the Soviet advisers
in the period of collaboration.<sup><a href="#fn144" id="r144">12</a></sup> The Nationalists utilized the
doctrinal bases of the <em>San Min Chu I</em>, tested in the social revolution
which arose from the Nationalist-Communist propaganda.
The great personal prestige of Sun Yat-sen was one of the most
important contributing factors to the growth of Nationalist
administration in Canton.</p>

<p>The military ability and political leadership of Chiang K'ai-shek
largely determined the success of the subsequent National
Government. Chiang created a military machine superior to
any other in China and coordinated army and government in
such a way as to add strength to both.<sup><a href="#fn145" id="r145">13</a></sup> But Chiang stood not
alone. His wife became his <em>alter ego</em> for press relations, and
important in her own right. His brother-in-law T. V. Soong,
resourceful financier, and his sisters-in-law, Mme Sun Yat-sen
(Sun's second wife) and Mme H. H. K'ung (wife of a later
minister of finance), were strong influences at Nanking. Yet
these members of the "Soong dynasty" did not shape the course
of Nanking policies as a closed concern. They were part of a
larger group sharing responsibility equally.</p>

<p>Once the National Government was established its success
was largely the result of success. Improvements in the international
status of China accrued to the prestige of the regime,
and a new surge toward reconstruction, delayed intolerably
long by the anarchy of <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em>, occurred as the result of the Nanking
hegemony. In the later years of the National Government,
before the Japanese onslaught transformed it into a quasi-military
regime fighting for its existence, the increased extent of
the national police power was brought into sharp relief. With
the extension of a unified gendarmery service over great parts
of the nation, and the development of a court system which
worked well except when under political pressure, the individual
came to face government as a reality&mdash;more than ever before,
under any dynasty. The government defied custom and tradition
in promoting public health, in attacking epidemics, in
sponsoring modern burial practices, and in deriding unhygienic
superstitions. In the broad field of mores which adjoins public
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" title="pg 188"> </a>
health, the influence of the government made itself felt&mdash;in
reducing the cost of marriage, in promoting municipal cleanliness
and tidiness in public places, in furthering temperance. The
New Life movement combined the prestige of the government
with the elasticity of voluntary association. In its closing days
Nanking whipped up an unprecedented wave of public spirit
among the masses.</p>

<p>As to government control of the economy, the Nanking government
aimed at system, in place of the inchoate conditions
which existed before its ascendancy. Chinese banks began to be
as reliable as those of the West. The currency was standardized
on a national basis. A national fiscal policy was adopted. A
great achievement was the introduction of a managed paper
currency in a country where specie alone had been respected
for ages. Agriculture, however, was lagging behind.</p>

<p>Government disavowed its previous identification with a
scholastic officialdom. It dispensed with a state religion,
although the commemoration of Sun Yat-sen compensated
in part for the change. Government disclaimed any vague
totalitarianism and instead clarified its zone of functioning
through the use of law. By narrowing the field of its authority,
it increased its effectiveness. Nationalization, centralization,
bureaucratization, the development of lawful process, the
emergence of a half-Western state working for Chinese needs&mdash;thus
may the growth of government be characterized in the
period after 1928. Obstacles remained, enough to dismay any
ruler; but they had become obstacles and were not impassable
barriers of cynicism, incomprehension, and futility.</p>

<p>The Japanese invasion of 1937 had two immediate effects on
the government. It shattered overnight the structure erected
by the Nanking regime. The work of a decade was undone.
On the other hand, the Japanese threat helped to drive
the Communists and Nationalists together and forced into the
national nexus those regional leaders who were maintaining the
last vestiges of separatism. Most consequential of all: Japan's
push&mdash;the greatest invasion the Chinese had known since the
1600's&mdash;thrust government and people toward each other.
Foreign troops taught inland China what nationalism really
meant.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" title="pg 189"> </a></p>

<p>They taught nationalism not merely with the fury of their
guns, or with the cruelties of their hysterical troops in Nanking.
The Japanese fostered nationalism most strikingly when they
drove inland the protagonists of nationalism. Students, merchants,
engineers, soldiers, administrators, physicians, and
scientists of the coast were forced into the far interior. Villagers
to whom the sight of these modern Chinese was as rare as the
sight of a lama in Arkansas now had such refugees dwelling among
them. The effect of forced cultural cross-fertilization is yet to
be seen, but it may prove to be of extraordinary significance.
Chinese able to hold their own with any representative of the
Western world can now be found in the remote valleys and
plateaus of the hinterland&mdash;twentieth-century China and timeless
China, united in their hatred of the invaders, and deeply
aware of their new national unity, their desperate need for power.</p>

<h2><a href="#contents">CONCLUSION</a></h2>


<p>Government in China has in the Republican era undergone
one of the most significant transformations to be found anywhere
in the world's political experience. The oldest society on earth
found itself forced to redefine its position and to reconstruct its
ways of thought and internal means of organization. Pressure
from without compelled China to adopt the modern state.
Chinese society was required to incorporate this state and all
implied institutions in its routine living. The earlier period
of the Republic marks an epoch in which modern forms had been
established in harmony with the accepted standards of the
Western state system. Chinese society fell into chaos beneath
the up-to-date superstructure. The later period witnessed the
correlation of state and society by coordination of ideological,
military, and governmental power. From the collapse of the
Manchu rule in 1911 to the operative zest of the National
Government at Nanking in 1937 there was a revolution in the
processes of government which for completeness can compare
with any century of Western transformation.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Collapse of the Imperial Society</a></em></p>

<p>Western ideology has failed to enter China as a constructive
whole, but it has smashed whatever reality there was to the old
world view. Western-educated Chinese leadership has undertaken
the task of governing a people which has learned only
indirectly of the West. In carrying out a program of adaptation,
contemporary Chinese leadership has relied on Sun Yat-sen's
phrase, "modernization without Westernization." But a
dilemma remains. How can the standards of the modern world
be divorced from their Western origins? How can Western
technology be used without the attitude of mind which has
created it and brought it to operative efficiency? How can a
world which never knew Rome or the Normanic <em>Curia Regis</em>
know jurisprudence? How can modern government be made
Chinese, when government itself has meant something far
different in China from what it has meant in the West?</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_192" title="pg 192"> </a></p>

<p>Further, the nature of Chinese leadership has not only been
transformed from being literary and ethical in its orientation to
being technical and legal; it has also been transformed socially
in the replacement of scholars by soldiers. The ideal ruler of
old was a humane classicist with a taste for historical studies;
the contemporary Chinese ruler must be military, if not militaristic,
and must have the inevitable background of engineering
and management which modern war connotes. The soldier
must collaborate with the modern administrator, while both
recapture the high ideals of devotion typical of the old scholastic
rule, even if they cannot use its substance. These imperatives
are indispensable if China is to live.</p>

<p>Finally, the language system which did so much to create and
then perpetuate the scholastic elite through thousands of years
of Chinese culture has now submitted to changes deeper and
more far-reaching than any in the past. The development of the
<em>pai-hua</em> school of literature and the progress of mass education
indicate that even with ideographs the Chinese can reach conditions
of uniform literacy approximating those which prevail in
the advanced Western nations. If the alphabetization of the
Chinese language, which is now in the form of tentative experiment,
should become a fact, even more striking developments
could take place. Reading and writing, and on this basis the
transmission of authoritative tenets, does not presuppose
profound economic adjustments. The modern Chinese will know
his classics increasingly through paraphrases no more difficult
than a newspaper column. When it is realized that the simplification
of intellectual activity is offered to a people schooled in the
idolatry of books, the potentialities of educational and intellectual
renaissance&mdash;already partially realized&mdash;become apparent.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the imperial world society of the
Confucians as a consequence of its encirclement by Westernized
states, with the passing of the scholars and the rise of Western-trained
soldiers, lawyers, and technicians, and with the alteration
of the linguistic and intellectual foundation upon which the old
society rested, what is there left of old China?</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Nature of the Transformation</a></em></p>

<p>In the first place, the ideological change is not complete.
No Western idea can enter China unimpaired. Sun Yat-sen
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_193" title="pg 193"> </a>
was influenced by the almost entirely contradictory notions of
Western nationalism, democracy, and socialism. In the <em>San
Min Chu I</em> their Western identity was destroyed, and the new
doctrines had much in common with the past. Western ideas
served largely as a mold; when the mold was removed, the form
was Western but the content was still Chinese. Mazzini and
Confucius might both approve of Sun's political doctrines.</p>

<p>Secondly, the extrapolitical agencies of Chinese life remain.
Chinese society may be shattered in dogma, but it persists in
fact. The family, though subject to legal redefinition caused by
Western cultural and economic influences, nevertheless plays a
role far greater than in the West. The village is still the fundamental
grouping among the rural masses. The guild system is
impaired by the Western impact, but the party organizations&mdash;Nationalist
and Communist&mdash;have absorbed much of the
strength which once lay in the <em>hui</em>. Under foreign domination,
these institutions may play a determining role in the struggle
against the intruder.</p>

<p>Thirdly, for modern government the Chinese have resources
of their own experience on which to rely. But they also have
Western devices and prescriptions. The National Government,
while falling short of Western levels of government efficiency,
nevertheless trained large numbers of Chinese to think in terms
of the modern state. But no new pattern has as yet crystallized.
Chinese political and military development may well present a
flexibility beyond Western grasp.</p>

<p>Fourth, the Chinese have still ahead of them the choice of
criteria of authority to prevail in society. Learning, office,
property played a decisive part in the old society. Hitherto,
the Republic has grown with three modes of power: ideological,
military, governmental. The relation between them is not yet
determined.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Problems of Government in China</a></em></p>

<p>Among the governmental problems confronting China the
acquisition of national territorial sovereignty stands out. Ever
since the establishment of the Republic the Chinese have grown
acutely conscious of the fact that some of their most important
economic centers have been lifted out of the national territory.
Sun Yat-sen realized in the frustration of his first efforts toward
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_194" title="pg 194"> </a>
republicanization and social policy that the problems of internal
government could not be settled unless the people as a whole were
free. Without general freedom there could be no question of
democracy, no question of a coordinated plan for the realization
of the <em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em> principle.<sup><a href="#fn146" id="r146">1</a></sup> Observing the intimate relation
between the <em>tuch&uuml;ns</em> and the foreign interests, which often
favored them, Sun and his followers began to stress their nationalist
role. With the Japanese invasion of the Northeast in 1931,
of Shanghai in 1932, of Inner Mongolia and North China in the
following years, and of China as a whole in 1937, the issue of
territorial sovereignty has become the most important one of all.
Until it is settled, all other questions must necessarily be considered
in their relation to it.</p>

<p>Second, the question of economic sustenance and development
is becoming pressing. Without an adequate economic base,
the Chinese population lives under the constant threat of simply
starving to death. Military difficulties emphasize this problem;
in fact, military effectiveness and strategy will have to depend
upon the physical existence of the people in and behind the lines.
The Chinese masses have lived close to the edge of starvation for
a long time. As a consequence, the Chinese cannot wage war
but in close proximity to the point of economic paralysis&mdash;plain
exhaustion of the physical necessities of life. The economic
problem cannot wait for spontaneous self-cure.</p>

<p>Third, the Chinese will have to recognize the need for politicalization
of public opinion. They must evolve the faculty of
transforming group opinion into governmental or organizational
action. They must acquire techniques for group collaboration
which will allow them to break down traditional groups into
more diversified units&mdash;a government commission, a factory
workshop, an army unit&mdash;without reference to family bonds or
village and <em>hui</em> connections. This is less a problem of doctrine
or education than one of habit and practice.</p>

<p>Fourth, the restoration of national prestige is necessary to the
security of the Chinese nation in the international sphere, and
to the wholesome development of the Chinese people within their
national boundaries as well. They cannot effectively borrow
from the West if they do so reluctantly, overcome by the thought
of inferiority or by shame. Unless they conquer their present
handicap, the Chinese will continue to lack self-confidence.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_195" title="pg 195"> </a></p>

<p>Fifth, the army problem must be solved. In the last analysis,
the excess of men under arms damages the Chinese military, as
the number of well-equipped effectives remains disproportionately
small. The hordes of half-armed soldiers constitute a heavy
burden upon the society, reduce the general economic level, and&mdash;by
affording one particular group a disproportionate opportunity
for making its preferences felt&mdash;brutalize the operation of public
opinion and discourage peaceable group pursuit.</p>

<p>Sixth, the Chinese state&mdash;if China is to solve political questions
through governmental procedures&mdash;must be constituted as a
clear and legal entity. The old imperial society of China was
able to dispense with law through reliance upon social forces
expressing themselves in a large number of small but stable
units. If these disappear the question arises: How can the
individual conceive clearly his relationships within Chinese
society? Systematized modern organization requires a legal
framework.</p>


<p class="noidt"><em><a href="#contents">The Question of Chinese Political Survival</a></em></p>

<p>That the Chinese will survive, biologically, as a race&mdash;this no
one doubts. That the Chinese will survive culturally is more
open to question. The Chinese absorbed all their conquerors
of the past because the country was large, because the people
were extraordinarily homogeneous in ideology and habit, because
the Chinese were wealthier than their conquerors and more
cultured. Absorption or cultural extinction is not a matter of
race; it is a question of ideology, of thought and the habits which
arise from ways of thought. What ways of thought are there
today that will absorb the conquerors? What ways of thought
are there that the conquerors might tear apart from the long
past, to change China into a mere geographical expression?</p>

<p>In the past, China has been conquered by invaders who
accepted the Chinese estimate of China, and who reciprocated
the Chinese self-esteem with a deep admiration for Chinese
culture. China's modern invaders bring with them a veritable
cult of national self-aggrandizement. Their fondness for the
Chinese past is mixed with contempt for modern China. Will the
Chinese preserve their national equanimity and sanity in the
face of such an attitude? Much depends upon their military
and political fortune and its effect upon their confidence.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_196" title="pg 196"> </a></p>

<p>Government in the Republican era demonstrates the fertility
and inventiveness of the Chinese mind in building political
and administrative institutions and in finding means of uniting
and controlling the Chinese as a people. When the chaos from
which they have been emerging is considered, their recent
accomplishments are an attestation of political ability. The
National Government and the Chinese Soviet Republic were
worthy adversaries; each met disastrous odds, not the least of
which was the other. Their governmental forms may be
destroyed and yet reappear so long as the Chinese remain Chinese
in the sense of their long past. Sun Yat-sen expressed his
countrymen's elementary social and national consciousness, so
different from the feverish nationalism of the West, in very clear
language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that we, Chinese, were naturalized English or Americans
and helped England or America to conquer China on the principle that
we accept cosmopolitanism, would our consciences, I ask you, be at rest
or not? If our consciences troubled us, that would be a sign that we
have nationalism; nationalism would trouble our consciences.<sup><a href="#fn147" id="r147">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such nationalism may prove indestructible. With democracy
and <em>min sh&ecirc;ng</em> as nationalism's corollaries, China promises to
contribute a gift of peace and political intelligence to the world,
and may yet return to her ancient role as the pacific preceptress
of nations.</p>

<h2><a href="#contents">CHRONOLOGY OF DYNASTIES</a></h2>


<p>This is the accepted time scheme in China. The dates are the Western
equivalents of the most widely current Chinese computation, which is
known to be incorrect or haphazard from the eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> back.
The periods given for the dynasties are chronological formulas rather than
the exact expression of political realities. For a discussion of the materials
of Chinese historiography, see Charles S. Gardner, <em>Chinese Traditional
Historiography</em>, Cambridge, 1938. For an excellent short summary of
Chinese history, see the "Historical Sketch" by Lei Hai-tsung in <em>The Chinese
Year Book</em>, 1936-1937, Shanghai. Chronologies are to be found in the major
Chinese-English dictionaries, and&mdash;among many others&mdash;in Leon Wieger,
S. J., <em>La Chine &agrave; travers les &acirc;ges</em>, Hsien-hsien, 1920, where they are accompanied
by a great deal of the old-style, uncritical, but nevertheless informative,
Chinese scholarship.</p>
